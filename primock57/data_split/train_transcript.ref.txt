did it help|day1_consultation02_doctor_u10
ok|day1_consultation02_doctor_u11
ok|day1_consultation02_doctor_u12
do you remember the name of the cream you bought|day1_consultation02_doctor_u13
ok steroid ok um would you say these symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms or different|day1_consultation02_doctor_u14
ok|day1_consultation02_doctor_u15
yes|day1_consultation02_doctor_u17
no well ok that's so you mentioned the itchiness um you also mentioned it's been quite sore|day1_consultation02_doctor_u18
um have you have you noticed any uh bleeding or discharge from your skins|day1_consultation02_doctor_u19
ok|day1_consultation02_doctor_u20
you've not haven't uh seen any other uh pus or blood coming out of your skin|day1_consultation02_doctor_u21
no and you mentioned it all started three days ago|day1_consultation02_doctor_u22
are you four days ago are you aware of any triggers or anything that you may have done that may have caused your symptoms to start|day1_consultation02_doctor_u23
so for example have you changed your uh shower gel any clothing|day1_consultation02_doctor_u24
have you been around anyone else|day1_consultation02_doctor_u25
mm|day1_consultation02_doctor_u26
mm no no ok that's ok um|day1_consultation02_doctor_u27
fine so just to resummarize for the last four days you've had very itchy skin very sore skin all over your body mainly your chest and did you also mention your arms and legs as well|day1_consultation02_doctor_u28
ok anything on your face at all|day1_consultation02_doctor_u30
on your face|day1_consultation02_doctor_u31
no ok and apart from this any other symptoms have you noticed for example have you noticed any temperature or fevers|day1_consultation02_doctor_u32
itchy ok so your your bowels are working ok|day1_consultation02_doctor_u33
your chest is ok no cough no breathing difficulties|day1_consultation02_doctor_u34
you're passing urine ok|day1_consultation02_doctor_u35
ok alright um|day1_consultation02_doctor_u36
it's always good to know so i mean do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms|day1_consultation02_doctor_u37
any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms|day1_consultation02_doctor_u38
ok that's ok so um normally at this stage i like to examine you um|day1_consultation02_doctor_u40
to see the rash itself to see exactly what type of rash it is but from what you've told me you mentioned it's you've got some dry skin and some uh cracked skin as well|day1_consultation02_doctor_u41
uh and has been very itchy and so would your um|day1_consultation02_doctor_u42
uh your your background of eczema um|day1_consultation02_doctor_u43
so|day1_consultation02_doctor_u44
sorry to say there's a couple of questions i wanted to ask you which i completely forgot my apologies um apart from the eczema do you have any other medical problems i should be aware of|day1_consultation02_doctor_u45
ok not anymore ok and do you take any regular medications at the moment|day1_consultation02_doctor_u46
no ok do you have any allergies to anything|day1_consultation02_doctor_u47
sorry i said do you have any allergies to anything|day1_consultation02_doctor_u48
hello|day1_consultation02_doctor_u50
can you hear me that's alright i think it uh do you have any allergies at all|day1_consultation02_doctor_u51
no ok um and tell me about your um uh your situation at home who do you live with|day1_consultation02_doctor_u52
ok and what do you do for work|day1_consultation02_doctor_u53
ok uh no no no that's that's absolutely fine um just a couple of questions i want to ask you which can sometimes affect your symptoms is do you smoke at all|day1_consultation02_doctor_u54
no and do you drink much in the way of alcohol|day1_consultation02_doctor_u55
ok ok ok i've got to say at this stage i've got to say this sound quality is not uh great but i will continue because we've come this far um|day1_consultation02_doctor_u56
so um based on everything you mentioned sarah i do wonder whether this is a flare up of your eczema um|day1_consultation02_doctor_u57
the reason being that you said it was quite itchy um it's mainly affecting your chest and your back|day1_consultation02_doctor_u58
um and uh having looked at your skin uh the the the rash does appear quite familiar um you mentioned using steroid creams yesterday|day1_consultation02_doctor_u59
um from the pharmacy i wonder whether giving you a stronger prescription of a of a steroid may be beneficial|day1_consultation02_doctor_u60
uh which i'm happy to prescribe to you today as well as i'm going to give you something some emollients which helps to moisturize the skin|day1_consultation02_doctor_u61
um which use in the bath and shower and it's definitely worth um using that for the first seven to ten days|day1_consultation02_doctor_u62
uh before we make the decision on whether it's working or not|day1_consultation02_doctor_u63
um it's also worth um using antihistamines which you can sometimes buy over counter|day1_consultation02_doctor_u64
things like loratadine or piriton which can help the itchiness of your skin|day1_consultation02_doctor_u65
and uh um it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms anything you wear or anything you use in terms of shower gels or soap|day1_consultation02_doctor_u66
because if that's causing your symptoms then we need to have a discussion about an eczema cu|day1_consultation02_doctor_u67
ohh could you say that again sorry|day1_consultation02_doctor_u68
ok|day1_consultation02_doctor_u69
ok so it's something for you to think about you can get different types of antihistamines i can give you something a little bit stronger today as well|day1_consultation02_doctor_u70
um something like fexofenadine which i can give to you today it's definitely worth trying and it's not going to do you any harm|day1_consultation02_doctor_u71
um but i think using the steroids and the emollients um on a regular basis|day1_consultation02_doctor_u72
uh over the next week to ten days should hopefully control your symptoms but do come back and see me next week if things don't get better|day1_consultation02_doctor_u73
ok um do you have any questions for me|day1_consultation02_doctor_u74
ok well i wish you all the best|day1_consultation02_doctor_u75

ok so it says here um you are feeling hot and have had severe headaches is that correct|day4_consultation02_doctor_u8
ok|day4_consultation02_doctor_u9
ok|day4_consultation02_doctor_u10
ok|day4_consultation02_doctor_u11
so those are lots of things are they all happening at the same time|day4_consultation02_doctor_u12
and do they all happen at the same time or is it one thing one time and one|day4_consultation02_doctor_u13
ok so let's start with the headaches when they do come do you have any idea the headache is going to come|day4_consultation02_doctor_u14
so it's normally at work|day4_consultation02_doctor_u15
ok and where does the headache sit in your head is it the front or the back|day4_consultation02_doctor_u16
ok and does it else|day4_consultation02_doctor_u17
does it go anywhere else|day4_consultation02_doctor_u18
and when you have the headaches specifically do you feel sick|day4_consultation02_doctor_u19
ok|day4_consultation02_doctor_u20
ok|day4_consultation02_doctor_u21
and do you normally get headaches before all of this started|day4_consultation02_doctor_u22
ok|day4_consultation02_doctor_u24
and then let's|day4_consultation02_doctor_u25
ok so talk to me about your job what do you do|day4_consultation02_doctor_u26
and do you work in london at the moment|day4_consultation02_doctor_u27
so do you get these headaches on your commute in to work|day4_consultation02_doctor_u28
ok and tell me about what you do do you sit in front of a computer most of the time or do you speak to people|day4_consultation02_doctor_u29
ok|day4_consultation02_doctor_u30
and these things have happened mostly when you're sitting at your computer|day4_consultation02_doctor_u31
ok and tell me what did you do before being a lawyer|day4_consultation02_doctor_u32
ok|day4_consultation02_doctor_u33
so talk to me about the stress that you're under at the moment if uh ten out of ten is extremely stressful and one out of ten is being on vacation where would moment|day4_consultation02_doctor_u34
and is that normal for you|day4_consultation02_doctor_u35
ok|day4_consultation02_doctor_u36
so you mentioned your headaches you also mentioned your reduced appetite so you don't want to eat as much|day4_consultation02_doctor_u37
have you lost weight|day4_consultation02_doctor_u38
can you remember how much you've lost|day4_consultation02_doctor_u39
and is that because you're going to the gym or is that unintentional|day4_consultation02_doctor_u40
ok so have you noticed your clothes feeling looser|day4_consultation02_doctor_u41
and have people said or commented that you've lost weight|day4_consultation02_doctor_u42
great and another thing that you also mentioned is that you noticed tingling in your hand|day4_consultation02_doctor_u43
so talk to me about that is it in one hand or both hands|day4_consultation02_doctor_u44
and do you get that in your legs as well|day4_consultation02_doctor_u45
and what does it feel like the tingling|day4_consultation02_doctor_u46
and again is this the first time you've noticed this|day4_consultation02_doctor_u47
ok|day4_consultation02_doctor_u48
and the other two things that i've just jotted down is you're feeling hot but you didn't mention that|day4_consultation02_doctor_u49
is that correct|day4_consultation02_doctor_u50
ok|day4_consultation02_doctor_u51
yes so do you feel short of breath while you're sitting at your desk|day4_consultation02_doctor_u52
ok and how about when you're exercising|day4_consultation02_doctor_u53
ok|day4_consultation02_doctor_u54
and the last thing is you mentioned that you noticed your heart beating|day4_consultation02_doctor_u55
again how often do you get that|day4_consultation02_doctor_u56
ok how long has that been happening for|day4_consultation02_doctor_u57
fine and apart from all of these things that you've told me do you have any other medical problems|day4_consultation02_doctor_u58
ok and do you take medications for that|day4_consultation02_doctor_u59
and are you remembering to take your medications|day4_consultation02_doctor_u60
ok and do you drink or smoke|day4_consultation02_doctor_u61
how much do you drink|day4_consultation02_doctor_u62
ok and how about smoking|day4_consultation02_doctor_u63
and uh i need to ask this to all of my patients but do you do anything else recreational in terms of drugs|day4_consultation02_doctor_u64
ok so you've never taken cocaine or marijuana|day4_consultation02_doctor_u65
ok thank you and are you allergic to anything|day4_consultation02_doctor_u66
good so you've told me lots of things happening to you at the moment and i can understand they probably feel quite strange and unusual|day4_consultation02_doctor_u67
um i think the best course of action is you come and see one of our doctors in the clinic|day4_consultation02_doctor_u68
we can give you an examination and what that means is we check your heart and your breathing|day4_consultation02_doctor_u69
make sure that those things are functioning correctly|day4_consultation02_doctor_u70
and probably do some blood tests for your thyroxine|day4_consultation02_doctor_u71
and take it from there how does that sound|day4_consultation02_doctor_u72
i think before we give you any medications we should see you in person|day4_consultation02_doctor_u73
so what we're going to do is book an appointment or i think you can book an appointment through the app to come and see us clinic and see one of my colleagues|day4_consultation02_doctor_u74
i'll let them know what you've told me today so you won't have to repeat exactly what you've said|day4_consultation02_doctor_u75
great do you have any questions|day4_consultation02_doctor_u76
thank you very much|day4_consultation02_doctor_u77

any side effects with that|day5_consultation10_doctor_u32
have you noticed any any um increased frequency of headaches since you started that|day5_consultation10_doctor_u33
ok and when you'd when you've had when you described your headaches in the past you said they were just general did you have any visual symptoms flashing lights nausea vomiting with them|day5_consultation10_doctor_u35
have you had your blood pressure checked recently with your pill|day5_consultation10_doctor_u36

ok and do you take any other drugs at all|day5_consultation10_doctor_u44
ok|day5_consultation10_doctor_u45
um so uh i mean it's obviously the first time you've had such a bad headache and you said you'd had some altered light in front of your eyes as well|day5_consultation10_doctor_u46
but you haven't had a high temperature have you checked your temperature|day5_consultation10_doctor_u47
ok um i mean it it it could possibly be a migraine type headache|day5_consultation10_doctor_u48
but the fact it's still ongoing for three days we probably should book you into an appointment to get an examination|day5_consultation10_doctor_u49
um obviously if it settles in the meantime then we can cancel that but we should do a neurological examination look at the back of your eyes as well|day5_consultation10_doctor_u50
um in terms of medication i can prescribe you something similar to ibuprofen but a bit stronger which you can take instead of ibuprofen and you can also take paracetamol at the same time|day5_consultation10_doctor_u51
so if you're happy to book a appointment with us with the support line for us to do a full examination|day5_consultation10_doctor_u52
and start the medication which i prescribe to you take it with food|day5_consultation10_doctor_u53
if if you're you said that when you go to bed your headache's ok and not waking you up in the night time|day5_consultation10_doctor_u54
ok any other family history of medical problems|day5_consultation10_doctor_u55
ok that's fine um i mean if if in the meantime before your appointment your headache is getting unbearable getting worse or changing then um if it's that bad then you should go to a and e and have an examination|day5_consultation10_doctor_u56
um you can call us for further advice on that|day5_consultation10_doctor_u57
and when when you have a an examination with us we'll check your blood pressure as well|day5_consultation10_doctor_u58
just to make sure your pill's still appropriate for you because sometimes if we if we do think it's a migraine then you would have to change your pill if you've had these flashing lights and things like that|day5_consultation10_doctor_u59
well some so that pill if you were having regular migraines with um flashing lights or other symptoms it wouldn't be suitable to stay on that pill particularly we'd have to change it to something else|day5_consultation10_doctor_u60
but you can carry on with that for the moment|day5_consultation10_doctor_u61
have you got any other questions|day5_consultation10_doctor_u62
uh|day5_consultation10_doctor_u63
yeah if you book an appointment with the support team then we can do a full examination then|day5_consultation10_doctor_u64
all right then take care|day5_consultation10_doctor_u65
bye|day5_consultation10_doctor_u66
hello|day1_consultation05_doctor_u0
good morning tim um how can i help you this morning|day1_consultation05_doctor_u1
ok|day1_consultation05_doctor_u2
right i'm sorry to hear that when when did your symptoms all start|day1_consultation05_doctor_u3
ok and whereabouts in your tummy is the pain exactly|day1_consultation05_doctor_u4
ok did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more gradual|day1_consultation05_doctor_u5
ok ok and can you describe the pain to me|day1_consultation05_doctor_u6
just in just below your belly button you uh mentioned|day1_consultation05_doctor_u8
ok um and is the pain constant or does it come and go|day1_consultation05_doctor_u9
mm hmm ok um and with the pain have you noticed any other symptoms at all so for example let's let's focus first on your bowels are your bowels working ok|day1_consultation05_doctor_u11
ok so you've got no other symptoms like diarrhea or loose stools|day1_consultation05_doctor_u12
no|day1_consultation05_doctor_u13
ok and what about your waterworks are you passing urine ok|day1_consultation05_doctor_u14
mm|day1_consultation05_doctor_u15
and when you mentioned pink urine do you was there any blood at all in your urine or was it difficult to say|day1_consultation05_doctor_u16
ok alright but otherwise it doesn't hurt uh or or or sting when you pass urine|day1_consultation05_doctor_u17
ok|day1_consultation05_doctor_u18
ok um ok and um moving on to other symptoms have you noticed any vomiting or feeling nauseous at all|day1_consultation05_doctor_u19
no vomiting any temperatures or fevers|day1_consultation05_doctor_u20
ok fine um uh uh and kim have to ask um uh all all all patients this this question is about your cycle if you don't mind me asking um are you currently um are you currently sexually active|day1_consultation05_doctor_u21
ok so you've had no other partner since then|day1_consultation05_doctor_u22
ok um uh and do you use any contraception at all|day1_consultation05_doctor_u23
at the moment ok fine um are you still having periods|day1_consultation05_doctor_u24
when was your last period|day1_consultation05_doctor_u25
two week scare ok so is there any chance you could be pregnant i know you've got an implement in there but is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant it's something for us to think about|day1_consultation05_doctor_u26
yeah ok well it's something for us to think about um uh maybe worth taking a pregnancy test later on just to confirm that um|day1_consultation05_doctor_u27
ok and and so just to summarize so far if you don't mind it's really for the last couple of days it's tummy pain that's really affected you mainly lower down towards your belly button it's quite burning you said it's getting worse um you noticed some pink urine|day1_consultation05_doctor_u28
um but no burning or stinging pain when you pass urine your bowels are working ok|day1_consultation05_doctor_u29
you've felt a little bit nauseous um and feeling hot and sweaty have i got that all right|day1_consultation05_doctor_u30
is there anything else perhaps that you feel like you should share with me at this stage anything that might be important|day1_consultation05_doctor_u31
yeah ok um tell me tell me a bit more about your um medical history otherwise are you normally fit and well|day1_consultation05_doctor_u32
ok um have you had anything like this before in the past any similar symptoms|day1_consultation05_doctor_u34
no ok um|day1_consultation05_doctor_u35
fine um any other family history i should be aware of anything relevant family uh related to bowels maybe related to history|day1_consultation05_doctor_u36
ok alright um and socially just tell me a bit more about your home situation who's at home with you|day1_consultation05_doctor_u37
ok um and uh are you currently working|day1_consultation05_doctor_u38
what do you do for work|day1_consultation05_doctor_u39
ok um|day1_consultation05_doctor_u40
ok um do you smoke at all kim|day1_consultation05_doctor_u41
no and do you drink much in the way of alcohol|day1_consultation05_doctor_u42
no ok|day1_consultation05_doctor_u43
ok um just before i go to the examination i just want to go through just some few screening questions if that's ok yes or no|day1_consultation05_doctor_u44
uh we've we've covered the majority of them already uh but i just want to make sure i'm not missing anything else|day1_consultation05_doctor_u45
um how's your how's your chest how's your breathing um any|day1_consultation05_doctor_u46
ok any uh funny heartbeats or rhythms palpitations|day1_consultation05_doctor_u47
ok any headaches any problems with your vision|day1_consultation05_doctor_u48
no ok alright um|day1_consultation05_doctor_u49
fine ok um so really just uh moving on um|day1_consultation05_doctor_u50
and so based based on your story really uh uh kim it's it's it's difficult it's it's um you know you've got some tummy pain you don't exactly know what's causing it it could be a few different things that could be causing your pain|day1_consultation05_doctor_u51
could just be a you know could just be a urine infection for example could just be something related to your gut um could just be something related to your you know a pregnancy related cause um and so it's probably worth doing some tests initially|day1_consultation05_doctor_u52
to try and rule out um what's going on here um which i can organize for you today|day1_consultation05_doctor_u53
um and basically those tests we we'll have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed but certainly it if it's been going on for the last couple of days um|day1_consultation05_doctor_u54
uh you know it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for a maybe urine infection and so it's an|day1_consultation05_doctor_u55
yeah absolutely so um i think it's certainly worth you know covering you with some antibiotics today|day1_consultation05_doctor_u56
uh but i still want you to bear in mind you know have a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here|day1_consultation05_doctor_u57
and um and i want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days time if your symptoms are not getting any better or indeed if they're getting worse|day1_consultation05_doctor_u58
so things to look out for would be you know worsening tummy pain um if you're feeling really hot or sweaty your temperature's not coming down um vomiting et cetera does that make sense|day1_consultation05_doctor_u59
ok um you can try just regular painkillers uh paracetamol would be advisable um make sure you drink plenty of fluids|day1_consultation05_doctor_u60
you can try some cranberry juice as well which uh can sometimes help with your urine symptoms|day1_consultation05_doctor_u61
um take the antibiotics uh and give me a call you know if you are worried about anything else|day1_consultation05_doctor_u62
yeah if i send it straight to your pharmacy start the antibiotics today something called trimethoprim um you can take two tablets uh one tablet twice a day for three days|day1_consultation05_doctor_u64
uh let's see how you get on|day1_consultation05_doctor_u65
great all the best|day1_consultation05_doctor_u66
bye bye|day1_consultation05_doctor_u67
hello hi i'm doctor jacob and welcome to babylon hello hi so um just before we start is it all right if you could confirm your name for me please and your date of birth|day3_consultation09_doctor_u0
and your email address for me please|day3_consultation09_doctor_u1
that's correct and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation|day3_consultation09_doctor_u2
right so you've mentioned that you have some pain in your jaw is that correct|day3_consultation09_doctor_u3
ok so numbness in the left arm yeah how long has it been going on for|day3_consultation09_doctor_u4
mm hmm|day3_consultation09_doctor_u5
mm hmm|day3_consultation09_doctor_u6
mm hmm|day3_consultation09_doctor_u7
right so have you mentioned that message and a warm bath any medications that you've taken so far|day3_consultation09_doctor_u8
uh huh|day3_consultation09_doctor_u9
ok|day3_consultation09_doctor_u11
mmm|day3_consultation09_doctor_u12
sure|day3_consultation09_doctor_u13
of course so you just mentioned that your pain is from elbow downwards is that you know the tingling numbness elbow not from your shoulder|day3_consultation09_doctor_u14
yeah so which fingers do you feel numb|day3_consultation09_doctor_u15
uh huh second third and fourth finger and is it your palm side or you know the back of your hand side which is numb or both|day3_consultation09_doctor_u16
it's the front side ok right and have you been dropping things at all like you know when you try to hold onto things like a glass or something have dropping it|day3_consultation09_doctor_u17
mm hmm|day3_consultation09_doctor_u18
so so you would say this in mind weakness mind so just to get my facts right so you would say it's definitely weakness rather than because of the pain you can't hold it that's two different things so you know sometimes you can't hold it because it's hurting you|day3_consultation09_doctor_u20
ok fine so you're definitely having some sort some form of weakness ok edward any neck pain at all|day3_consultation09_doctor_u21
neck pain and all ok right ok so just a bit more of a background because i don't have much information on the system um do you have any past uh medical history that you'd like to share|day3_consultation09_doctor_u22
mm hmm|day3_consultation09_doctor_u23
what|day3_consultation09_doctor_u24
mm hmm|day3_consultation09_doctor_u25
ok|day3_consultation09_doctor_u26
mm hmm|day3_consultation09_doctor_u27
yeah|day3_consultation09_doctor_u28
do you have any headaches at all from the in the recent past|day3_consultation09_doctor_u29
hmm|day3_consultation09_doctor_u30
do you wear glasses at all glasses contact lenses|day3_consultation09_doctor_u31
no so no glasses and you've not experienced anything like a seizure or a fit anything like that|day3_consultation09_doctor_u32
like when you you lose consciousness and you start shaking|day3_consultation09_doctor_u33
ok no fits yeah ok and your weakness is only in your left arm legs are walking and all this normal yeah|day3_consultation09_doctor_u34
you mentioned for a while you couldn't see you know the outside peripheral vision from your left eye how long did that episode last for|day3_consultation09_doctor_u35
sure ok um ok so is there any regular medications that you're using|day3_consultation09_doctor_u36
ok|day3_consultation09_doctor_u37
ok|day3_consultation09_doctor_u38
alright|day3_consultation09_doctor_u39
and any family history you'd like to share any significant family history|day3_consultation09_doctor_u40
yeah|day3_consultation09_doctor_u41
mm hmm|day3_consultation09_doctor_u42
yeah right any neurological conditions in the family|day3_consultation09_doctor_u43
there are related conditions no ok that's fine|day3_consultation09_doctor_u44
ok so right so after you know speaking and examining you know yourself i think it's quite important that we do investigate it a bit further i'm just wondering whether there's something a bit more than just the boxing here|day3_consultation09_doctor_u45
ok few things that's made me think other than just like a boxing injury is for instance um you know when you said you can't your vision went your peripheral vision was not there for about twenty so and that with the weakness of the arms make me think is there something else going on rather than just an injury|day3_consultation09_doctor_u46
sometimes you know you do get things like ms multiple sclerosis so people with multiple sclerosis can have um visual problems like what you've experienced and sometimes you know the odd numbness tingling sensations going on ok|day3_consultation09_doctor_u47
we if we capture it a bit early there are treatments for it ok i'm not obviously i'm not suggesting that you do have it but it is quite important to find out that whether you have it or not that's the most serious kind of thing that needs to be uh dealt with here|day3_consultation09_doctor_u48
yeah so what we can do is i'm going to do an urgent very urgent neurology referral yeah what they what that might entail is the brain scan and things like that hello|day3_consultation09_doctor_u49
i know this might sound a bit of a shock to you um but i'm i think it is more important that we investigate this a bit more seriously|day3_consultation09_doctor_u50
ok any questions at all|day3_consultation09_doctor_u51
no that's something we can't do the treatment for it is actually some steroids and things like that uh when you have an acute you know acute reaction or things like that but saying that first we need to firm diagnosis|day3_consultation09_doctor_u52
yeah while you're waiting for this to be done if there's any weakness uh you know if the weakness progresses to your legs or there's any kind of headaches vomiting fits and your visual symptoms are getting worse and not getting better then that would be an a and e|day3_consultation09_doctor_u53

ok|day1_consultation08_doctor_u15
ok all right well i'm sorry to hear that and i hope it gets better|day1_consultation08_doctor_u16
um going back to your skin i mean is it anything you've done perhaps uh which may have triggered your symptoms anything you've touched or you know for example shower gels soaps fabric fabric cleaners|day1_consultation08_doctor_u17
ok is that the first time in your life or have you been before|day1_consultation08_doctor_u18
ok and did your symptoms start after you went swimming|day1_consultation08_doctor_u19
ok all right um you mentioned you've had no other fevers is that right no fevers no vomiting|day1_consultation08_doctor_u20
no how's your health otherwise|day1_consultation08_doctor_u21
and all we'll get to medication in just a second um do you do you feel generally run down do you feel tired|day1_consultation08_doctor_u22
ok ok are you eating and drinking ok|day1_consultation08_doctor_u23
your appetite's fine is it ok and your bowels are your bowels working ok|day1_consultation08_doctor_u24
uh no no problems with vomiting or loose stools|day1_consultation08_doctor_u25
ok and your waterworks are uh all ok you're passing urine ok|day1_consultation08_doctor_u26
ok all right um so just moving on in terms of your other medical history is there anything else i should be aware of|day1_consultation08_doctor_u27
microgynon|day1_consultation08_doctor_u28
ok do you know what that is|day1_consultation08_doctor_u29
ok it's a contraceptive pill|day1_consultation08_doctor_u30
does that make sense is that something you're is that does that ring a bell now|day1_consultation08_doctor_u31
ok is there any other medications that you take|day1_consultation08_doctor_u32
no so in terms of your medical history there's no problems of skin problems in the past things like eczema or um dermatitis|day1_consultation08_doctor_u33
sorry what was that you think it's|day1_consultation08_doctor_u34
the|day1_consultation08_doctor_u35
the weather|day1_consultation08_doctor_u36
ohh you think the ok you think the weather ok|day1_consultation08_doctor_u37
ok no that's ok no no problems well um uh move do you do you suffer from allergies are you someone who suffers from allergies|day1_consultation08_doctor_u38
food allergies medication allergies|day1_consultation08_doctor_u39
lactose intolerant ok that could be helpful to know um fine and tell me of family history is there anything in the family that you're aware of|day1_consultation08_doctor_u40
hayfever ok um fine but any again any skin problems that you're aware of|day1_consultation08_doctor_u41
no ok all right socially who do you live with at home|day1_consultation08_doctor_u42
live alone|day1_consultation08_doctor_u43
and uh do you smoke at all do you can i ask do you smoke are you a smoker|day1_consultation08_doctor_u44
do you drink much in the way of alcohol|day1_consultation08_doctor_u45
recreational drugs|day1_consultation08_doctor_u46
ok and you said you you work as a primary school teacher|day1_consultation08_doctor_u47
uh the reason i ask is sometimes stress can be a contributing factor um you felt you noticed yourself find uh life's been more stressful recently is that right|day1_consultation08_doctor_u48
do you think that might have any correlation to your symptoms|day1_consultation08_doctor_u49
ok all right um fine um|day1_consultation08_doctor_u50
ok well normally at this stage i like to proceed to examination but um based on your uh story|day1_consultation08_doctor_u51
um it's difficult i think that you know you've essentially the story is you've got a dry itchy rash on your mainly your hands you mentioned um and your arms which started perhaps after swimming a few days ago|day1_consultation08_doctor_u52
um but no other symptoms you're feeling otherwise well no fevers no bleeding or discharge from skin|day1_consultation08_doctor_u53
i wonder whether you may have something called dermatitis um have you heard of that condition before|day1_consultation08_doctor_u54
ok um great well i can give you a patient information leaflet about that which gives a bit more information about the disease but um it it's something that we can readily treated um|day1_consultation08_doctor_u55
with couple options we have steroid creams i can give you um which will help with the inflammation|day1_consultation08_doctor_u56
and uh something called emollients which can help with the dry dry skin|day1_consultation08_doctor_u57
and that's something you just need to kind of paste on uh on to your skin uh throughout the day for the next few days um and hopefully that helps your symptoms|day1_consultation08_doctor_u58
um you can also try antihistamines so you can get things over the counter piriton loratadine they can sometimes help with the itchiness|day1_consultation08_doctor_u59
ok and um that's probably what i recommend paracetamol on this occasion wouldn't be helpful|day1_consultation08_doctor_u60
um uh uh painkillers wouldn't be helpful on this occasion but let's let's let's see how the next few days go|day1_consultation08_doctor_u61
and if it's still not getting better come back and see me next week and we can have another look again at your symptoms|day1_consultation08_doctor_u62
right do you have any questions for me|day1_consultation08_doctor_u63
ok well i wish you all the best have a good day|day1_consultation08_doctor_u64

ok well have you taken anything at all for the blotching|day3_consultation06_doctor_u19
ok so you've ok that's fine so from what you're saying you do need to have medical attention straight away ok um do you have any antihistamines in your house at all|day3_consultation06_doctor_u20
so why why and i'm because your your breathing problem can get worse very quickly i would like you to call is there someone else at home with you|day3_consultation06_doctor_u21
uh no i wouldn't want your wife to take you i would like i'd like her to call the ambulance because that might take a bit longer and you know we need to deal with it quickly so what we are worried about is you know in case you develop an anaphylactic reaction|day3_consultation06_doctor_u22
yeah so i'll ask her to give you the um antihistamine in the meantime while the ambulance is coming and take yourself to hospital|day3_consultation06_doctor_u23
um it might just be an articularly reaction but because you're complaining of breathing difficulties it is quite important that you go to hospital straight away|day3_consultation06_doctor_u24

three days ago ok and whereabout in your head is this pain|day1_consultation13_doctor_u5
ok um and is the headache there all the time or does it come and go|day1_consultation13_doctor_u6
ok so it comes and fine ok and if i was to ask you on a scale of one to ten um ten being the worst type of pain you ever had how would you rate this headache|day1_consultation13_doctor_u7
eight and if i was to ask you describe the headache to me um in terms of the nature of the pain is it sharp is it dull is it crampy is it throbbing|day1_consultation13_doctor_u8
mm hmm|day1_consultation13_doctor_u9
mm hmm|day1_consultation13_doctor_u10
so you think the headache is getting worse over the last three days|day1_consultation13_doctor_u11
ok have you tried anything which has made the headache better|day1_consultation13_doctor_u12
did that help|day1_consultation13_doctor_u13
ok all right and except for the headaches any other symptoms at all|day1_consultation13_doctor_u14
so example any problems your eyesight or your vision|day1_consultation13_doctor_u15
so when you say annoying does it hurt to look uh look at bright lights|day1_consultation13_doctor_u16
ok and um have you had any loss of vision or blurry vision|day1_consultation13_doctor_u17
mmm ok any nausea or any vomiting|day1_consultation13_doctor_u18
when you say sick you mean you feel sick ok yeah no vomiting ok any neck pain or neck stiffness|day1_consultation13_doctor_u19
ok and any difficulty with speaking or um speech|day1_consultation13_doctor_u20
any difficulty with weakness in your arms and legs|day1_consultation13_doctor_u21
ohh really ok ok yeah probably well i'll i'll ask you a bit more about your work later on um any recent head injuries at all|day1_consultation13_doctor_u22
ok and have you had anything like this before in the past|day1_consultation13_doctor_u23
or uh or similar similar to similar to this kind of headache|day1_consultation13_doctor_u24
not ok all right um any temperatures or fevers|day1_consultation13_doctor_u25
any rashes at all on your skin|day1_consultation13_doctor_u26
ok and just moving forwards are you otherwise fit and well adriana|day1_consultation13_doctor_u27
you fit and well do you have any other medical history|day1_consultation13_doctor_u28
any history of migraines at all|day1_consultation13_doctor_u29
ok um fine i'll ask you a bit more about that in just a second before i go any further can i ask do you take any regular medication|day1_consultation13_doctor_u30
are you on the pill|day1_consultation13_doctor_u31
ok do you have any allergies to any medications|day1_consultation13_doctor_u32
ok so you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines|day1_consultation13_doctor_u33
are they is that normally well controlled or are they um having difficulty controlling their symptoms|day1_consultation13_doctor_u34
mm hmm ok|day1_consultation13_doctor_u35
ohh right ok fine um socially tell me a bit more about your life outside of um outside of work so who lives at home with you|day1_consultation13_doctor_u36
ok excellent and are you working at the moment you mentioned this impacting on your work|day1_consultation13_doctor_u37
mmm ok do you wear glasses|day1_consultation13_doctor_u38
have you had any uh have you had any recent eye check done eye test|day1_consultation13_doctor_u39
ok all right something for you to bear in mind if you feel that you are your eyes are straining um i would always recommend having a repeat eye test done um have you been feeling more stressed or anxious at work recently|day1_consultation13_doctor_u40
ok all right great um regarding smoking or alcohol do you drink or smoke at all|day1_consultation13_doctor_u41
but only socially|day1_consultation13_doctor_u42
ok|day1_consultation13_doctor_u43
right now um adriana do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms have you have you read anything online or spoken to people|day1_consultation13_doctor_u44
mm hmm|day1_consultation13_doctor_u45
mmm|day1_consultation13_doctor_u47
ok is it anything in particular you were hoping i could do for you today|day1_consultation13_doctor_u48
ok|day1_consultation13_doctor_u49
how many tablets did you take of ibuprofen|day1_consultation13_doctor_u50
three a day ok all right um so uh adriana so um really what i think is going on here i uh unfortunately i do think this could be a headache very similar to a migraine|day1_consultation13_doctor_u51
um the reason i say that is because the history is very suggestive of it given your mum and your sister also migraines i think it's something for us to think about|day1_consultation13_doctor_u52
um now i'm not saying it's gonna keep happening but it may just be a one off but it's certainly worth treating it today stronger analgesia or painkillers|day1_consultation13_doctor_u53
um now moving forward we have some options which we can discuss uh you tried the ibuprofen now my only worry is i'm not sure whether you're taking the correct dose you can take up to two tablets three times a day|day1_consultation13_doctor_u54
so so there's definitely room for improvement there or i can prescribe you something stronger like naproxen which is another anti inflammatory which can be helpful|day1_consultation13_doctor_u55
um we can also add in other painkillers like paracetamol or codeine which might be helpful as well|day1_consultation13_doctor_u56
ok and i think it's certainly worth looking into that so i can give you a prescription for that today um with regards to um the next few days it may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out what's you know if there's any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse|day1_consultation13_doctor_u57
and and you know i'd like you to come back and see me in about uh a week's time week to two weeks' time|day1_consultation13_doctor_u58
if you are having more frequent episodes of these type of headaches we can think about giving you medications as prophylactic which basically means medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis but we can have that discussion next time|day1_consultation13_doctor_u59
ok in the meantime if your headaches aren't getting any better or they're getting worse um you know i want you to give me a call or come back and see me sooner ok|day1_consultation13_doctor_u60
so if you're having any problems with your vision or weakness in your arms and legs or you're just not feeling very well just give me a call and come back and see me|day1_consultation13_doctor_u61
all right|day1_consultation13_doctor_u62
great well have a good day|day1_consultation13_doctor_u63
bye|day1_consultation13_doctor_u64
yep can you find|day2_consultation01_patient_u2

yeah so i just feel i can't really hear as well as i used to like my hearing is kind of deteriorating in some way|day2_consultation01_patient_u5
uh about six weeks|day2_consultation01_patient_u6
um i had something maybe about a year ago but it only lasted a couple of days it wasn't anything as long as this|day2_consultation01_patient_u7
um i occasionally get like a ringing in my left ear uh just on the one side and um there's actually been a few times when i felt kind of a bit sick or a bit dizzy as well|day2_consultation01_patient_u8
uh just the left ear yeah|day2_consultation01_patient_u9
it seems be yeah|day2_consultation01_patient_u10
mh mm|day2_consultation01_patient_u11
yeah|day2_consultation01_patient_u12
uh it's kind of on and off like some things trigger it as well so for example if i'm watching tv or listen to music or something that'll solve the ringing in the ear|day2_consultation01_patient_u13
uh no my left ear|day2_consultation01_patient_u14
uh not specifically apart from the dizziness so much|day2_consultation01_patient_u16
uh nah i'll do it|day2_consultation01_patient_u18
ok|day2_consultation01_patient_u19
ok|day2_consultation01_patient_u20
yeah|day2_consultation01_patient_u21
uh nothing major it's just kind of uh it's it's not the kind of dizziness you get with nausea like uh not not proper room spinning or anything like that but just just a little bit kind of off balance|day2_consultation01_patient_u22
no|day2_consultation01_patient_u24
is that the sort of thing that can cause uh like this uh ringing i've got in my ear 'cause it seems|day2_consultation01_patient_u26

that's correct and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation|day3_consultation03_doctor_u6
alright so you've mentioned that you're not having much of an appetite and energy lately i'm sorry to hear that could you tell me a bit more about it please|day3_consultation03_doctor_u7
so so you are you telling me that your your mood's low is that what you're trying to tell me|day3_consultation03_doctor_u9
your mood would you say you're depressed|day3_consultation03_doctor_u10
it's a tough one isn't it because we don't want to actually say|day3_consultation03_doctor_u11
uh do you like your work do you like your work|day3_consultation03_doctor_u12
you like your work ok and um you and how are things at home alright are you having any kind of stress at home|day3_consultation03_doctor_u13
and have you lost any weight|day3_consultation03_doctor_u14
ok right so you mentioned that you've lost your appetite for a while now so how long are we talking about|day3_consultation03_doctor_u15
we talking about two months three months or six months|day3_consultation03_doctor_u16
and a half months ago but you said your weight loss is much longer than that|day3_consultation03_doctor_u17
sorry could you i couldn't hear you what did you say your weight loss how long|day3_consultation03_doctor_u18
at least six months would you say|day3_consultation03_doctor_u19
six months and roughly how much have you lost just approximately|day3_consultation03_doctor_u20
so about a stone yeah six months ok ok ok|day3_consultation03_doctor_u21
right ok so just a few more questions it might seem a bit awkward but it's quite relevant ok so how are your bowels are they ok|day3_consultation03_doctor_u22
yeah um your bowels how's your toilet|day3_consultation03_doctor_u24
ok|day3_consultation03_doctor_u25
so you're not going to the toilet|day3_consultation03_doctor_u26
you are going like to be very more specific you don't have any diarrhoea|day3_consultation03_doctor_u27
ok so there's blood in the poo no mucus nothing of that sort|day3_consultation03_doctor_u28
just now you mentioned nausea have you been ever sick with it|day3_consultation03_doctor_u29
ok well just the nausea ok is there any particular foods that make you nauseous|day3_consultation03_doctor_u31
ok so you can't think of any real do you suffer from acid reflux|day3_consultation03_doctor_u32
ok ok you also mentioned that you're feeling short of breath so yeah is there any cough|day3_consultation03_doctor_u33
ok|day3_consultation03_doctor_u34
yeah is it like in closed spaces|day3_consultation03_doctor_u35
so how far can you walk and when you start feeling short of breath so how far can you walk with no shortness of breath|day3_consultation03_doctor_u36
walk you start with walk do you feel short of breathlet's start this way do you feel short of uh breath when you walk at all|day3_consultation03_doctor_u37
right you so you can walk about a mile and you don't feel short of breath at all|day3_consultation03_doctor_u38
ok so just explain a bit more just make myself clear about the lift thing so you said you're short of breath when you're in the lift|day3_consultation03_doctor_u39
described them like palpitations to me yeah so that's what you're you're feeling your own heartbeat|day3_consultation03_doctor_u40
yeah ok you get any chest pains with it|day3_consultation03_doctor_u41
ok|day3_consultation03_doctor_u42
ok no chest pains|day3_consultation03_doctor_u43
ok alright fine so what we need to do um just before that um just a few more things uh any any past medical history you'd like to share with me today|day3_consultation03_doctor_u44
sorry you had thyroid problems|day3_consultation03_doctor_u45
ohh yeah underactive thyroid yes yep|day3_consultation03_doctor_u46
yeah you're taking thyroxine are you using it every day|day3_consultation03_doctor_u47
why is that|day3_consultation03_doctor_u48
ok so is that so all these things are since you've stopped taking the thyroxine|day3_consultation03_doctor_u49
when was your last blood test|day3_consultation03_doctor_u50
ok so you've not had a blood test|day3_consultation03_doctor_u51
right ok it could you know generally for you know for underactive thyroids what symptoms you've said um it's the opposite that usually happens yeah it's for overactive thyroid like you can feel a bit like the racing of your heart beat and all so i'm not quite clear on what picture we are having here yeah|day3_consultation03_doctor_u52
i think a general set of bloods is a good good start so what we look at because you're not you're not having the umph aren't you you're like you're just feeling a bit you know low and things like that right well um and weak and things like that so we'll just do a general set of bloods we look at things like anaemia how your kidney functions are your livers all that with vitamin levels and your|day3_consultation03_doctor_u53
ok and uh now after we get those set of bloods we will find out if we can find anything in them if that's all clear then we would need to do a physical examination ok|day3_consultation03_doctor_u54
we would need to then go in and do but there's nothing from what your history you've said that that we urgently warrant a physical examination at this point in time i think it's a good idea to start off with a blood test and then take it from there|day3_consultation03_doctor_u55
obviously with palpitations or chest pain if you get that's more of a medical emergency you need to go to a and e for that ok if things change you've mentioned now your bowels are fine and you're not being sick so if that's the case it's ok but if your you know bowels change or you're being sick again you need to get in touch with us ok|day3_consultation03_doctor_u56
sorry could you repeat that|day3_consultation03_doctor_u57
mm hmm|day3_consultation03_doctor_u58
ok so let's do all the blood tests first and we'll take it from there ok but you know if you have any chest pains or change in bowel habits do get in touch with us|day3_consultation03_doctor_u59
ok now what we need to do is now you need to ring up support and i'll the form for you but in the interim you need to call support so that we can organise that blood test for you and when you get the result you will receive a text message through your phone to tell you to book an appointment if you're feeling poorly don't wait for that just get in touch with us again yeah|day3_consultation03_doctor_u60

right ok ok i'm sorry that must be very difficult for you|day1_consultation14_doctor_u39
quite lethargic and weak you mentioned um ok and um april are you normally otherwise fit and well|day1_consultation14_doctor_u40
uh fit and well so do you have any other medical history|day1_consultation14_doctor_u41

yep|day1_consultation14_doctor_u44
zinopril ok fine any allergies at all to medications|day1_consultation14_doctor_u45
no ok regarding any family history is there anything i should be aware of|day1_consultation14_doctor_u47
ok alright who's looking after your diabetes is there anyone is there a doctor in a hospital who looks after your diabetes|day1_consultation14_doctor_u48
right excellent and in terms of your social situation who lives at home with you|day1_consultation14_doctor_u50
lives ok um fine is your partner well at the moment|day1_consultation14_doctor_u51
right ok so he|day1_consultation14_doctor_u52
go away he's got away with it at the moment ok and uh are you working at the moment april|day1_consultation14_doctor_u53
yeah|day1_consultation14_doctor_u54
no i can imagine what is it that you do for work|day1_consultation14_doctor_u56
ohh so you work in the it field ok it field right ok uh|day1_consultation14_doctor_u57
no has it been quite stressful recently|day1_consultation14_doctor_u58
ok|day1_consultation14_doctor_u59
the reason i ask is sometimes|day1_consultation14_doctor_u60
sure reason i ask is because sometimes stress can really affect your immune system um but uh it's good to know you're you're you're not feeling stressed|day1_consultation14_doctor_u61
um do you smoke at all april|day1_consultation14_doctor_u62
ok um and what about alcohol|day1_consultation14_doctor_u63
and what is it that you drink|day1_consultation14_doctor_u64
the wine how much do you drink on those nights|day1_consultation14_doctor_u65
ok so um yeah so you're probably just about under the limit of um the recommended limit|day1_consultation14_doctor_u66
something think about just in terms of your blood pressure and diabetes maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can|day1_consultation14_doctor_u68
really ideally the the the right answer is to cut down completely but so in practice i know that's not realistic so maybe for the first few weeks why don't you cut down to two glasses a week and then one week thereafter|day1_consultation14_doctor_u70
um and if you are coping ok then you can maybe try and cut down altogether|day1_consultation14_doctor_u71
ok just something for you to think about um right so uh just as we wrap up really um april i think based on your story i think uh essentially i think you're you're going through a bit of a bit of a viral illness um i don't think there's anything to worry about|day1_consultation14_doctor_u72
you know you've had a bit of a cough bit of a runny nose feeling quite weak and lethargic|day1_consultation14_doctor_u73
i'm hoping that you know you're probably over the worst of it now it's been five days i'm hoping you're maybe going to get better in the next couple of days it normally lasts for about a week to ten days|day1_consultation14_doctor_u74
yeah absolutely so you know things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to you know get some nice good rest|day1_consultation14_doctor_u75
drink plenty of fluids keep yourself well hydrated you can take regular paracetamol|day1_consultation14_doctor_u76
if you feel like you're still not getting any better in two to three days it's probably worth coming back to see me again we can check you over|day1_consultation14_doctor_u77
and if you are still feeling feverish um and your cough isn't getting any better then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest some of the uh uh common source of infection um|day1_consultation14_doctor_u78
yeah so i think you know really i think it depends on you it's um if you are coughing then there is a theoretical you know risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still so i would say maybe take a day or two off work if you can|day1_consultation14_doctor_u79
uh and get some good bed rest um and maybe think about work early next week|day1_consultation14_doctor_u80
but um if your cough isn't getting any better or your breathing is getting worse i want you to come back and see me sooner ok|day1_consultation14_doctor_u81
no no no nothing to worry about otherwise|day1_consultation14_doctor_u82

um any blurred vision or any pain over your eyes|day5_consultation12_doctor_u12
any any funny lights or anything like that in your vision area any problems when you look into the light|day5_consultation12_doctor_u13
um and have you been eating and drinking ok|day5_consultation12_doctor_u14
are you feeling sick or vomiting or anything|day5_consultation12_doctor_u15
any high fevers are you feeling shivery sweaty|day5_consultation12_doctor_u16
any any rashes at all|day5_consultation12_doctor_u17
and in the past have you had any headache before|day5_consultation12_doctor_u18
ok how bad would you say the headache is from zero to ten if ten is the worst pain that you could have and zero is nothing|day5_consultation12_doctor_u19
ok and have you taken any pain killers|day5_consultation12_doctor_u20
ok and did that make any difference|day5_consultation12_doctor_u21
and last night did you manage to sleep through the night ok|day5_consultation12_doctor_u22
has it been worse at any particular time of the day|day5_consultation12_doctor_u23
any difference if you lie down stand up bend over cough or sneeze or anything like that|day5_consultation12_doctor_u24
and have you got any other medical problems|day5_consultation12_doctor_u25
anything you take medication for|day5_consultation12_doctor_u26
um any over the counter medications or allergies|day5_consultation12_doctor_u27
that's fine and any stomach problems or asthma at all|day5_consultation12_doctor_u28
anyone in your family got any medical problems|day5_consultation12_doctor_u29

do you drink any alcohol regularly|day5_consultation12_doctor_u36
um and any other drugs|day5_consultation12_doctor_u37
no ok um i mean the fact that you haven't had headaches before um is is unusual the fact that they've developed is there anything you think's changed any increased stress change in your diet or lifestyle|day5_consultation12_doctor_u38
ok so what we would suggest is trying a slightly stronger pain relief|day5_consultation12_doctor_u39
uh so similar to ibuprofen but taking instead of ibuprofen not at the same time and taking that regularly with food|day5_consultation12_doctor_u40
um hopefully that will settle it down you can take paracetamol along with that|day5_consultation12_doctor_u41
try and um take rest have lots of good hydrationum but if the pain's getting worse or you get new symptoms fever rash vomiting neck stiffness|day5_consultation12_doctor_u42
um or you keep getting episodes of the same type of thing then we need to speak to you and and make a plan for for what we can do next|day5_consultation12_doctor_u43
have you got any other questions|day5_consultation12_doctor_u44
well i should think it should down if it's getting worse or not settling in the next day or two|day5_consultation12_doctor_u45
then certainly give us a call back if when you've tried the medication that i've prescribed from the pharmacy|day5_consultation12_doctor_u46
ok|day5_consultation12_doctor_u47
all right then thanks a lot bye|day5_consultation12_doctor_u48

right then ok so it's quite a seems like a quite severe allergy to it is is that right um ok fine in terms of your family history is there anything i should be aware of um related to kidneys bladder bowels guts|day1_consultation09_doctor_u32
ok all right and tell me a bit more about your home situation who's lives who's at home with you|day1_consultation09_doctor_u33
ok and what|day1_consultation09_doctor_u34
ok and are you a are you working at the moment or are you a student|day1_consultation09_doctor_u35
ok and what are you studying|day1_consultation09_doctor_u36
and how's that going|day1_consultation09_doctor_u37
great do you have any aspirations for the future in terms of careers|day1_consultation09_doctor_u38
recommend it we need doctors um what about smoking and alcohol do you drink much in the way of do you do you smoke or do you drink much in the way of alcohol|day1_consultation09_doctor_u39
so socially ok all right um right excellent so um at this stage i i would proceed to examination|day1_consultation09_doctor_u40
but um based on your story um just to summarise really so last three days you've been having bit of burning pain on passing urine a bit of crampy tummy pain lower down|day1_consultation09_doctor_u41
um essentially but but no other fevers or back pain uh if i if i understand correctly|day1_consultation09_doctor_u42
i think probably do have what we call a simple uti or urinary tract infection bladder infection um which can be readily treated so i'll give you a course of antibiotics today|day1_consultation09_doctor_u43
something called either nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim uh and it's normally a three day course uh so one tablet twice a day for three days|day1_consultation09_doctor_u44
and that should hopefully help your symptoms but i also advise you to drink plenty of fluids let's try and flush that you know that infection out of your body if you can|day1_consultation09_doctor_u45
um you can try cranberry juice that can sometimes help with your symptoms|day1_consultation09_doctor_u46
um and if you're still not better by the end of this week i want you to give me a call or come back and see me and uh we can have another look at your symptoms|day1_consultation09_doctor_u47
ok|day1_consultation09_doctor_u48
yeah yeah absolutely and things to look out for would be you know if you are having kind of high temperatures a back pain um just generally feeling more unwell|day1_consultation09_doctor_u49
uh you know i do want you give me a call back 'cause then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys which is something we wanna avoid so do do give me a call if you're having any concerns ok|day1_consultation09_doctor_u50
yeah i mean if you can try and avoid it i think that'd be sensible um uh it's great that you're using barrier contraception i would recommend you to continue using barrier contraception but if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up that'd probably be the best for you and your boyfriend|day1_consultation09_doctor_u51
all right|day1_consultation09_doctor_u52

ok fine alright um|day2_consultation03_doctor_u39
so what i think go on|day2_consultation03_doctor_u40
ok so um uh obviously we're limited in terms of assessment via the video uh portal|day2_consultation03_doctor_u43
um from what you've told me this doesn't seem to be you know anything um that you're gonna die from however i would like you to be assessed in a clinic today|day2_consultation03_doctor_u44
ok i would like you to come to one of my clinics i would like a gp to assess you what you're what you're describing might be something called bell's palsy ok um|day2_consultation03_doctor_u45
we can go into that explaining what that is if um if that's confirmed on on physical examination but um that's not usually a life threatening problem|day2_consultation03_doctor_u46
but um part of the reason why i'd like you to come in it's just that we can do a a what we call a a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on and confirm that might be the diagnosis have a look have a look inside the ear see if there's any anything to see within the ear|day2_consultation03_doctor_u47
so um um so in answer to your question no i don't think that you need to worry about that i think you know preliminarily i can i can reassure you|day2_consultation03_doctor_u48
however in order to definitively reassure you i i think you need a physical examination today ok so what i wanna do is i'm gonna send a message to our admin team i'll ask them to book you in for a face to face appointment in one of our clinics|day2_consultation03_doctor_u49
um within central london ok and then you can ring the the support team number i'll leave that number in your notes and you can ring them after five minutes and then they'll slot you in to a place that's convenient for you ok|day2_consultation03_doctor_u50
all right so someone will see you and hopefully you will be able to reassure further but please make sure the appointment gets done today|day2_consultation03_doctor_u51
all right then ok nice to see you take care|day2_consultation03_doctor_u52

uh yeah uh my name is april and i'm fifty|day1_consultation14_patient_u1
well i've just been having this like cough for quite a few days and my nose is running um and it's just been super annoying and it's not going away|day1_consultation14_patient_u2
uh i think it started like maybe a bit less than a week ago like maybe maybe five or six days ago|day1_consultation14_patient_u3
uh it's just so continuous it's really really frustrating it's quite dry and it's just all day it like keeps me up at night as well which is really annoying|day1_consultation14_patient_u5
i mean apart from i mean the coughing is giving me a sore throat but it's not like you know not more than than that you know just just my throat is irritated from coughing but it's not like it's not that bad when i swallow or anything|day1_consultation14_patient_u6
nothey feel ok actually yeah nothing nothing on the ears|day1_consultation14_patient_u7
um i don't think so like i guess i get laboured when i'm coughing and i can't breathe but i not yeah not i i don't think so not really|day1_consultation14_patient_u8
i don't feel restless no i feel you know generally tired|day1_consultation14_patient_u9
so like yeah but not not anything special with my chest|day1_consultation14_patient_u10

um i've been having like like shivers even when i'm in when i'm in bed|day1_consultation14_patient_u12
you know like when you when you go to sleep and and you feel like i i should be warm but i'm still still you know shivering a little bit|day1_consultation14_patient_u13
but i haven't taken my temperature so i'm not a hundred percent sure if i had a fever but it feels like i probably did 'cause i was just i was next to my boyfriend and he was completely warm and totally fine and i just like couldn't stop shivering and kept adding more sweaters on and i was still cold|day1_consultation14_patient_u14
no no no nausea no vomiting like um yeah nothing like that|day1_consultation14_patient_u15
um i mean it's ok i at the beginning like when i was starting to have the the the coughing and stuff|day1_consultation14_patient_u16
um i had a little bit of diarrhea um but but it didn't it didn't cut my appetite or anything i just like my stomach wasn't feeling great|day1_consultation14_patient_u17
yeah yeah it got better it was only like the first like it started at the same time as the cough started and then it stopped so i thought everything would be fine but then the cough just kept going|day1_consultation14_patient_u18
with my what|day1_consultation14_patient_u19
ohh uh no no no it's fine|day1_consultation14_patient_u20
no i i drank loads of water when i started having the diarrhea now that it stopped i just went back to normal|day1_consultation14_patient_u21
uh like my you know when i had the when i was telling you i had like the i had chills and i was really cold my muscle was really hurting|day1_consultation14_patient_u22
sometimes i do pilates but like it's hurting me so much at the moment um so to be honest all i feel like doing is just lying in bed|day1_consultation14_patient_u23
yeah right especially like in my arms my legs like just everywhere basically|day1_consultation14_patient_u24
yeah pretty much|day1_consultation14_patient_u25
am i normally what|day1_consultation14_patient_u26
uh well i have type two diabetes and i have quite high blood pressure|day1_consultation14_patient_u27
um i take metformin for the diabetes and i take lisinopril for the high blood pressure|day1_consultation14_patient_u28
no no allergies|day1_consultation14_patient_u29
uh my dad also has type two diabetes but i think that's it|day1_consultation14_patient_u30
i just regularly go see a doctor|day1_consultation14_patient_u31
um that just checks up on it same with the high blood pressure like i i have it under control and since i've started taking this medication i've just been like regularly checking that it it's under control|day1_consultation14_patient_u32

yeah work in it|day1_consultation14_patient_u38
not too active a job uh yeah|day1_consultation14_patient_u39

i've been able to take a day off to try and recover so yeah i don't think it's related|day1_consultation14_patient_u41
i used to but i've stopped for about six months now|day1_consultation14_patient_u42
i mean yeah i i don't think i drank that much like i i don't really know how you count the units so i guess like i don't drink more than like like let's say three evenings a week and i rarely get like properly drunk or anything|day1_consultation14_patient_u43
wine mostly|day1_consultation14_patient_u44

hi|day4_consultation04_doctor_u0
hi how are you|day4_consultation04_doctor_u1
ok my name is doctor|day4_consultation04_doctor_u2
i'm one of that work for babylon|day4_consultation04_doctor_u3
can i confirm your name and date of birth please|day4_consultation04_doctor_u4
ok and are you in a space that's quiet and private|day4_consultation04_doctor_u5
ok and you mentioned that you are wheezy|day4_consultation04_doctor_u6
can you tell me a little bit more about that|day4_consultation04_doctor_u7
ok so you were cleaning the house two days ago and that's when it first started|day4_consultation04_doctor_u8
did the wheezing start suddenly or was it gradual|day4_consultation04_doctor_u9
and has it got worse over the past two days|day4_consultation04_doctor_u10
ok|day4_consultation04_doctor_u11
and have you taken anything for the wheeze|day4_consultation04_doctor_u12
ok and so and the wheeze has been getting worse and today you're particularly worried is it because you're finding it hard to breathe or finding it hard to talk|day4_consultation04_doctor_u13
ok|day4_consultation04_doctor_u14
ok|day4_consultation04_doctor_u15
and when you can breathe and you take a deep breath do you notice any pain|day4_consultation04_doctor_u16
ok and have you noticed yourself feeling dizzy or the rooms spinning more than normal|day4_consultation04_doctor_u17
ok and have you been eating and drinking ok particularly water|day4_consultation04_doctor_u18
ok and are you normally fit and well or do you have any other medical problems|day4_consultation04_doctor_u19
and when you get hay fever do you take any medications for it|day4_consultation04_doctor_u20
ok|day4_consultation04_doctor_u21
and your asthma did it resolve when you were a child|day4_consultation04_doctor_u22
ok so do you still have your inhalers|day4_consultation04_doctor_u23
ok|day4_consultation04_doctor_u24
but you don't see your doctor regularly for asthma|day4_consultation04_doctor_u25
ok|day4_consultation04_doctor_u26
and apart from this do you know if you're allergic to anything|day4_consultation04_doctor_u27
ok and how far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment|day4_consultation04_doctor_u28
how far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment|day4_consultation04_doctor_u29
ok good|day4_consultation04_doctor_u30
so given that you've had a history of asthma when you were a child|day4_consultation04_doctor_u31
and you get hay fever sometimes in the summer|day4_consultation04_doctor_u32
your shortness of breath|day4_consultation04_doctor_u33
hi i've lost um video signal can you still hear me|day4_consultation04_doctor_u34
so given you've got a history of asthma and|day4_consultation04_doctor_u36
hay fever this could be one of two things|day4_consultation04_doctor_u37
but we want to rule out asthma or an allergy first|day4_consultation04_doctor_u38
so what you'll need is visit one of our clinics so we can do some more tests|day4_consultation04_doctor_u39
such as check your|day4_consultation04_doctor_u40
so the first thing we would do is use a small device on your finger to check the amount of oxygen in your blood|day4_consultation04_doctor_u41
and from that we can tell if it's asthma or something else|day4_consultation04_doctor_u42
before this happens if you've got something like an antihistamine which you normally take for hay fever at home i would take one just in case it is an allergy you've had from the dust|day4_consultation04_doctor_u43
you might be able to get one on your way to the doctor's surgery if not they can prescribe you one|day4_consultation04_doctor_u44
yes and it they're normally about four to six pounds|day4_consultation04_doctor_u45
is there anything else that you're particularly worried about you want to ask me|day4_consultation04_doctor_u46
yes that is and you may need to take some steroids now but we cannot we we won't be able to know until we've done those tests first|day4_consultation04_doctor_u47
cool so i'm gonna write a letter for your gp just to let him know what's happened and the consultation with the gp in person shouldn't take too long|day4_consultation04_doctor_u48
probably ten minutes|day4_consultation04_doctor_u49
cool um you should get the letter over the app and then we can you can take yourself to the gp|day4_consultation04_doctor_u50
cool|day4_consultation04_doctor_u51

ok it's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain like this normally it's when you eat um bad food or food that has gone off and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested but just to double check have you noticed any problems with your breathing|day4_consultation05_doctor_u40
ok|day4_consultation05_doctor_u41
ok and how about chest have you noticed any chest pain|day4_consultation05_doctor_u42
ok and how about um walking and talking are those all both ok|day4_consultation05_doctor_u43
yep and when you press on your tummy does it cause any pain|day4_consultation05_doctor_u44
ok|day4_consultation05_doctor_u45
sorry i was just writing some things down|day4_consultation05_doctor_u46
so what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and it's causing your tummy pain and it's this is normally called gastroenteritis so an infection of the tummy|day4_consultation05_doctor_u47
normally when patients have this do some things number one is to drink lots of water and fluids because you're losing lots at the moment number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers so if you start getting a temperature then you need|day4_consultation05_doctor_u48
and please stay home for the time being until you get slightly better|day4_consultation05_doctor_u49
and normally|day4_consultation05_doctor_u50
normally things like antibiotics don't help they make the situation worse|day4_consultation05_doctor_u51
so that's|day4_consultation05_doctor_u52
go ahead|day4_consultation05_doctor_u53
so i think that's what we should do for the time being if you feel you're getting much worse than i would suggest you go and see your gp in real in real life in person so they can loot at your belly|day4_consultation05_doctor_u54
great cool do you have any more questions for me|day4_consultation05_doctor_u55
yes|day4_consultation05_doctor_u56
so the the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had but if your things don't get worse then that's something that we can look up from the gp|day4_consultation05_doctor_u57
does that sound ok|day4_consultation05_doctor_u58
thank you|day4_consultation05_doctor_u59

ok ok|day1_consultation15_doctor_u17
ok|day1_consultation15_doctor_u18
yeah i think that might be quite important actually i think there's definitely maybe a correlation between the two|day1_consultation15_doctor_u19
um fine and so you mentioned something about having general dryness is that you mentioned in your legs as well|day1_consultation15_doctor_u20
is that is that something you've you've had for a while now|day1_consultation15_doctor_u21
ok|day1_consultation15_doctor_u22
right ok|day1_consultation15_doctor_u23
ok i'm just going to ask you some very brief yes or no questions if that's ok with your symptoms have you have you had any other symptoms such as fever or temperatures|day1_consultation15_doctor_u24
any nausea or any vomiting|day1_consultation15_doctor_u25
any problem with your bowels|day1_consultation15_doctor_u26
any problem with your urine or waterworks|day1_consultation15_doctor_u27
otherwise you feel well do you and yourself your eating drinking your appetite is well maintained|day1_consultation15_doctor_u29

no ok alright um|day1_consultation15_doctor_u41
fine in terms of social history you mentioned that you work as a housekeeper um are you you're not always very good at wearing gloves|day1_consultation15_doctor_u42
um you've recently changed jobs which which kind of places do you work in is it mainly residential or is it commercial|day1_consultation15_doctor_u43
hotel ok|day1_consultation15_doctor_u44
ok ok|day1_consultation15_doctor_u45
do you think there might be a relationship between the two between the kind of the products you're using and your symptoms|day1_consultation15_doctor_u47
ok have your symptoms stopped you from doing any work have you had to take time off work recently|day1_consultation15_doctor_u48
ok can i ask a couple questions do you smoke at all|day1_consultation15_doctor_u49
do you drink much in the way of alcohol|day1_consultation15_doctor_u50
once a week|day1_consultation15_doctor_u51
a week ok so very minimal alcohol there um|day1_consultation15_doctor_u52
have you tried anything for your symptoms have you tried anything over the counter any creams|day1_consultation15_doctor_u53
any luck with that|day1_consultation15_doctor_u54
no ok alright um|day1_consultation15_doctor_u56
ok alright|day1_consultation15_doctor_u57
um mrs parkinson so i think um based on your story i i think you might have something called dermatitis or contact dermatitis which is very common in particularly people in your in your in your field who are using cleaning products not using gloves and sometimes you get a bit of reaction between the chemicals and your skin|day1_consultation15_doctor_u58
um so moving forward there's a couple of options so firstly what we try and do is you know avoid the triggers in your case i strongly recommend that you wear gloves when cleaning at all times|day1_consultation15_doctor_u59
ok and in terms of helping your dryness and the cracking of your skin um we can try some steroid creams to help with the inflammation|day1_consultation15_doctor_u60
as well as some stronger emollients um which you really need to kind of coat on three four times a day for the next couple of weeks just to help with the moisturizing of your skin|day1_consultation15_doctor_u62
um if it still hasn't got better in about a week two weeks time i really need you to come back and see me again and we can maybe think about other things we can give to you|day1_consultation15_doctor_u64
is that all clear|day1_consultation15_doctor_u66
great do you have any questions for me|day1_consultation15_doctor_u67
i'll i'll i'll do a prescription for you now and send it over to your pharmacy|day1_consultation15_doctor_u68
ok|day1_consultation15_doctor_u69
i think i think minimum couple of weeks uh ten days to fourteen days um and if it still hasn't got better or indeed if it's getting worse like if it's spreading or dryness is getting worse come back and see me sooner|day1_consultation15_doctor_u70
ok|day1_consultation15_doctor_u71
great thank you laura thank you|day1_consultation15_doctor_u72
bye bye now|day1_consultation15_doctor_u73
hello|day4_consultation01_doctor_u1
yeah i can can you hear me|day4_consultation01_doctor_u2
hi my name is doctor gohill|day4_consultation01_doctor_u3
i'm one of hi i'm one of the physicians that works at babylon|day4_consultation01_doctor_u4
are you in a quiet and private space to talk|day4_consultation01_doctor_u5
good and can i confirm your name and date of birth please|day4_consultation01_doctor_u6
seventy four and how old does that make you|day4_consultation01_doctor_u7
perfect|day4_consultation01_doctor_u8
great and it says here um it says you're having chest discomfort is that correct|day4_consultation01_doctor_u9
ok can you tell me a little bit more about your chest discomfort when it started and how you're feeling at the moment|day4_consultation01_doctor_u11
ok|day4_consultation01_doctor_u12
great so you've talked about your chest are you still in discomfort at the moment|day4_consultation01_doctor_u13
ok and when it started how would you rate it out out of ten|day4_consultation01_doctor_u14
ok|day4_consultation01_doctor_u15
ok and how about now|day4_consultation01_doctor_u16
ok and tell me before this happened what were you doing|day4_consultation01_doctor_u17
ok|day4_consultation01_doctor_u18
ok and how often do you do gardening|day4_consultation01_doctor_u19
ok and are you normally fit and well so are you normally ok to garden as you would|day4_consultation01_doctor_u20
great and apart from this do you have any other medical problems|day4_consultation01_doctor_u21
ok so that's high blood pressure and high cholesterol do you take any medicines for that|day4_consultation01_doctor_u22
ok and are you allergic to anything|day4_consultation01_doctor_u23
ok so let me summarise what you've told me already you were gardening a few hours ago and you experienced chest discomfort which was roughly seven out of ten|day4_consultation01_doctor_u24
and it feels more like someone's sitting on your chest as opposed to pain|day4_consultation01_doctor_u25
and apart from this have you noticed anything else unusual specifically with your breathing|day4_consultation01_doctor_u26
ok and is that getting worse or better|day4_consultation01_doctor_u27
and when you get short of breath when you're walking up the stairs have you noticed any pain|day4_consultation01_doctor_u28
ok so let me confirm you have the pressure at the moment and you have shortness of breath is that correct|day4_consultation01_doctor_u29
so given what you've told me about your past medical history i think it might be worth you calling an ambulance|day4_consultation01_doctor_u30
get you to the hospital as soon as possible because my concern is it might be something to do with your heart|day4_consultation01_doctor_u31
so while to you i will ring an ambulance who should come to your address|day4_consultation01_doctor_u32
but in the meantime i think we should stay on the phone so i can gather some more information that we can give to the paramedics is that ok|day4_consultation01_doctor_u33
it's nothing to worry about at the moment but given that you've got high blood pressure and high cholesterol and you've got some chest pain i'm always worried about the heart first before anything else|day4_consultation01_doctor_u34
and we and we need to look after your heart before anything else|day4_consultation01_doctor_u35
so apart from this light headedness and this chest discomfort have you noticed anything else unusual|day4_consultation01_doctor_u36
did you have anything to eat or drink this morning|day4_consultation01_doctor_u37
and you feel still feel nauseous at the moment|day4_consultation01_doctor_u38
so i have a couple of other questions to ask you and i'm gonna reel them off so apologies for not letting you talk very much|day4_consultation01_doctor_u39
have you noticed this pressure radiating to your head|day4_consultation01_doctor_u40
and how about to your left or right arm|day4_consultation01_doctor_u41
and does that pain go anywhere else to your left arm or to your back|day4_consultation01_doctor_u42
and have you noticed any problems swallowing or drinking water|day4_consultation01_doctor_u43
good|day4_consultation01_doctor_u44
and have you noticed any problems going to the loo|day4_consultation01_doctor_u45
and you're normally fit and well apart from the two things you told me about|day4_consultation01_doctor_u46
and do you live at home with your wife at the moment|day4_consultation01_doctor_u48
ok i would suggest if she's there you let her know that you'll both be having an adventure to the hospital today so she might need to get your things together|day4_consultation01_doctor_u49
the ambulance should be there very soon in the meantime i would suggest that you stay calm and have some water if you need to|day4_consultation01_doctor_u50
don't take any of those medications|day4_consultation01_doctor_u51
and the paramedics should be with you very shortly|day4_consultation01_doctor_u52
so when they do come there are two things they will be worried about|day4_consultation01_doctor_u53
the one is your chest so your heart and the second is your breathing which is your lungs|day4_consultation01_doctor_u54
so they will give you lots of things to breathe through and attach things to your arms just to check things like your blood pressure and your heart rate so don't be worried|day4_consultation01_doctor_u55
and when you get to the hospital you'll be seen by a consultant pretty pretty much immediately|day4_consultation01_doctor_u56
sure so i will let the paramedics do their job and when you're at the hospital the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes to let me know how everything's going|day4_consultation01_doctor_u58
great i'll um book another appointment to see you soon uh once you've had your adventure|day4_consultation01_doctor_u59
no problems do you have any questions for me|day4_consultation01_doctor_u60
great thank you very much|day4_consultation01_doctor_u61

that's perfect thank you for that are you um john are you in a private place where you're ok to speak at the moment|day2_consultation06_doctor_u4
perfect thank you for that ok so tell me what the problem is you've been having some difficulty breathing is that correct|day2_consultation06_doctor_u5
right ok so when did this bee sting or bee bite occur|day2_consultation06_doctor_u6
right ok um and your your lips don't seem swollen to me right now but do they which can you show me with your finger where you feel it's swollen|day2_consultation06_doctor_u7
sure|day2_consultation06_doctor_u8
sure ok uh you said you've been having some difficulty breathing|day2_consultation06_doctor_u9
your breathing seems all right to me right now um the reason why i'm clarifying is because we have to decide whether this is a an acute emergency whether i need to send you in to hospital straight away|day2_consultation06_doctor_u11
or whether we more time to ask questions ok so um do you feel like you've got difficulty breathing right now this minute as we speak|day2_consultation06_doctor_u12
sure sure|day2_consultation06_doctor_u13
sure no you uh you did the right thing and i and i can understand it it is quite anxiety provoking ok all right can i just double check before we carry on asking other questions have you got history of anaphylaxis|day2_consultation06_doctor_u14
no ok have you ever been given an epipen|day2_consultation06_doctor_u16
no ok all right|day2_consultation06_doctor_u17
let let's um take a step back now so in terms of the bee sting it was a did you see a bee or you're you're just um assuming it was a bee|day2_consultation06_doctor_u18
one of the two|day2_consultation06_doctor_u19
ok and um the area of your body that it stung where was it did you say it was your arm|day2_consultation06_doctor_u20
all right and you've got a rash there can i have a look|day2_consultation06_doctor_u21
ok all right that looks ok to me right now does it look red to you at the moment|day2_consultation06_doctor_u22
yeah yeah yeah the puncture mark yeah ok all right um now is is there any swelling around that area that you can see i i couldn't see any|day2_consultation06_doctor_u25
sure ok all rightum now have you taken any medication it's probably a you probably haven't 'cause it was a few minutes ago but have you is not taken any antihistamines or anything like that|day2_consultation06_doctor_u26
ok now um if i can just go back do you have any history of any any kind of illnesses at all|day2_consultation06_doctor_u28
ok|day2_consultation06_doctor_u29
ok have you got a history of any allergies to anything|day2_consultation06_doctor_u30
all right good um and in your family is there any history of any illnesses or any history of any kind of acute reactions|day2_consultation06_doctor_u31
right and um do you have allergies to any kind of cats or dogs or pets or anything like that|day2_consultation06_doctor_u34
yeah and you've got no food allergies as far as you're aware|day2_consultation06_doctor_u36
ok|day2_consultation06_doctor_u37
um can i ask do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks or anything like that|day2_consultation06_doctor_u38
right ok have you ever been on medication for that|day2_consultation06_doctor_u39
ok|day2_consultation06_doctor_u40
um great now um i need to ask a few questions maybe not directly related to this but just it's for for general information purposes|day2_consultation06_doctor_u41
so um are you working at the moment|day2_consultation06_doctor_u42
what do you work as|day2_consultation06_doctor_u43
ok and um you living alone|day2_consultation06_doctor_u44
ok do you have any pets at home|day2_consultation06_doctor_u45
a cat ok great|day2_consultation06_doctor_u46
what i'd like to do now if that's ok john is i'd like to have a look inside your mouth ok|day2_consultation06_doctor_u47
um one of the things that um we'd be worried about if someone's going to have an acute allergic reaction is to see whether there's any swelling of the lips or the tissues inside the mouth or the|day2_consultation06_doctor_u48
soft tissues of the airway and um i can i've got a fairly good view of your lips but i'd like maybe if you can bring your device closer to your mouth and then put your head back mouth open wide sit somewhere where there's good lighting and i just wanna have a look inside the throat if that's ok|day2_consultation06_doctor_u49
perfect ok great now um um can can i just get you to do it again and just say ah this time|day2_consultation06_doctor_u50
ok fantastic brilliant ok um|day2_consultation06_doctor_u51
uh john based on um how you look how you're talking to me and how you're breathing and the appearance and your wrist|day2_consultation06_doctor_u52
um i don't feel that you're having a an an a life threatening uh allergic reaction|day2_consultation06_doctor_u53
now it's very normal to have a rash when you have some kind of insect bite it's uh it's a localised um uh inflammatory reaction that um is normal and that immediate reaction that redness and that maybe slight swelling is usually temporary|day2_consultation06_doctor_u54
what we're worried about is when someone has um compromise of their breathing so you mentioned breathing difficulties and you mentioned swelling of your lip thankfully i can't see any of that right now|day2_consultation06_doctor_u55
but that's the most urgent and most pressing thing that we'd be watching out for|day2_consultation06_doctor_u56
given that it hasn't happened initially it's unlikely to happen later ok we so we have like a stage one and stage two reaction for these types of bites|day2_consultation06_doctor_u57
and usually if you're gonna have the reaction it will happen straight away|day2_consultation06_doctor_u58
so we may be coming out of the danger zone now it's um but i'm just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are in case it happens so for example|day2_consultation06_doctor_u59
you would have swelling of the lips difficulty breathing you might have something called stridor which is an inspiratory sound that you when you're trying trying to breathe it makes like a rasping sound like this ok|day2_consultation06_doctor_u60
thankfully you don't have anything like that right now it seems to me like this is a localised allergic reaction|day2_consultation06_doctor_u61
however if anything changes if anything deteriorates either make an appointment with us or go straight to a and e|day2_consultation06_doctor_u62
um uh and in some cases if it's if it's uh progressing rapidly it's better to go straight to a and e rather than to wait for a booked appointment with us ok|day2_consultation06_doctor_u63
what i'd like you to do now is i'd like you to try and take some antihistamines|day2_consultation06_doctor_u64
so you can buy them over the counter you can get piriton or chlorphenamine and you can take one tablet four milligrams um up to about six times a day ok|day2_consultation06_doctor_u65
or you can just take a one a day one whichever is your preference that's that's absolutely fine there's no no issue that should be enough to control this|day2_consultation06_doctor_u66
um if the redness in your arm spreads and you it feels hot or you you know you have signs of any localised infection|day2_consultation06_doctor_u67
we may need to think about other treatments like an antibiotic|day2_consultation06_doctor_u68
and like i said if anything deteriorates in terms of your breathing that's urgent and we need to process that action needs to be taken urgently|day2_consultation06_doctor_u69
did you have any other um queries or was there anything else that you're worried about|day2_consultation06_doctor_u70
yeah that's that's over the yeah over the counter you don't need to any chemist will have it you don't need a prescription for that yeah it's probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually than to get it via prescription|day2_consultation06_doctor_u71
ok um now um uh on the basis of what you've told me i don't think you need any allergy testing i think this is just a a straightforward localised reaction to a an insect bite|day2_consultation06_doctor_u72
however if it was to happen that you know this you're you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other non specific rashes we might need to think about blood testing i don't think we're at at that moment yet ok|day2_consultation06_doctor_u73
so uh but that's something to bear in mind in case this becomes a recurrent pattern|day2_consultation06_doctor_u74
ok then so we'll leave it like that for now ok i'm gonna leave a link to some information about anaphylactic reactions just for you to read about it i don't want you to panic but just for you to be aware what symptoms are|day2_consultation06_doctor_u75
if those kind of things happen get back to us|day2_consultation06_doctor_u76
if you're feeling worried just have a lower threshold for having a chat with us sometimes a chat is all you need to calm things down|day2_consultation06_doctor_u77
all right then john ok uh well we'll leave it like that come back to us if you have any further issues|day2_consultation06_doctor_u78
my pleasure all right take care then all the best|day2_consultation06_doctor_u79

and it's really like i can't like go to uni properly i'm just like constantly looking for the toilet|day1_consultation10_patient_u5
um and it kind of hurts sometimes when i'm like in at the bottom of my tummy as well|day1_consultation10_patient_u6

ok and um have you tried any painkillers for this already|day4_consultation06_doctor_u19
ok um ok um what time did you take the paracetamol how long ago was it you'd taken it|day4_consultation06_doctor_u20
ok um and your visual problem is still ongoing now|day4_consultation06_doctor_u21
ok ok um so what about have you felt sort of nauseous or like you want to vomit|day4_consultation06_doctor_u22
still feel|day4_consultation06_doctor_u23
all right ok you've mentioned in the past you've had kidney stones any other medical problems|day4_consultation06_doctor_u24
uh you've mentioned that in the past you've had kidney stones have you had any other medical problems in the past|day4_consultation06_doctor_u25
what else do you have in the family|day4_consultation06_doctor_u26
ohh can you still hear me ohh it's gone you can hear me um you said you mentioned your mother has migraines what else do you have in the family|day4_consultation06_doctor_u27
hyperthyroid|day4_consultation06_doctor_u28
ok bye ok um and no other relevant family history|day4_consultation06_doctor_u29
and do you take any regular medications|day4_consultation06_doctor_u30
are you allergic to any medications|day4_consultation06_doctor_u31
ok is there any chance you could be pregnant|day4_consultation06_doctor_u32
fine and so you're not allergic to any medications fine from|day4_consultation06_doctor_u33
and what what were you thinking might be going on i know you seemed quite worried about it was there anything in particular you were worried about|day4_consultation06_doctor_u34
ok ok fine um now just uh another uh question have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs anything like that|day4_consultation06_doctor_u35
uh and when you're walking you're able to walk fine in a straight line or is your your uh walk are you walking a bit funny|day4_consultation06_doctor_u36
ok|day4_consultation06_doctor_u37
ok so just just to clarify what what you said this morning uh you woke up and then later on in the in the morning about four hours ago you've developed a headache|day4_consultation06_doctor_u38
um on the left side of the head|day4_consultation06_doctor_u39
left side of the head is it behind the eye|day4_consultation06_doctor_u40
is it behind the eye is that where the pain is|day4_consultation06_doctor_u41
um you've|day4_consultation06_doctor_u42
ok that's fine you've noticed that your vision is blurry there's funny lines you feel a bit nauseous you vomited twice|day4_consultation06_doctor_u43
um and uh you feeling dizzy as well but your you've got no neurological symptoms you're walking fine|day4_consultation06_doctor_u44
um and and you've taken paracetamol and it hasn't helped is that all ok|day4_consultation06_doctor_u45
so it sounds like what you're suffering from is what's known as a migraine is that something you've heard of before|day4_consultation06_doctor_u46
ok|day4_consultation06_doctor_u47
ok so um usually with with migraines they can present at different times in people's lives so sometimes they can present as a child sometimes they can present when they're older|day4_consultation06_doctor_u48
um and sometimes they can present you know even postmenopausally|day4_consultation06_doctor_u49
so there's different there's different ways you can get migraines uh and the reason why this sounds like migraines is because it's on one side of the head|day4_consultation06_doctor_u50
typical of a migraine you've got blurry vision again which is very typical with the nausea and vomiting that's also typical of a migraine|day4_consultation06_doctor_u51
now um uh obviously if the headache is really severe and i'll suggest some medications you can try if that doesn't work we would want to see you um as soon as possible to do like a full neurological exam as well|day4_consultation06_doctor_u52
to make sure that you know there's you know when we do a more specific examination that um everything all seems fine|day4_consultation06_doctor_u53
um i i would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you uh if you take some medications maybe something like ibuprofen|day4_consultation06_doctor_u54
so yes a migraine yeah no you know even sooner than that we can look at maybe half an hour to forty minutes depending on what your response to it is for some people|day4_consultation06_doctor_u55
uh whatever medications they take the migraine doesn't improve um and they can last from anywhere from four hours to seventy two hours migraines can last um but|day4_consultation06_doctor_u56
no so what there's lots of medication treatments so there's it can be ibuprofen with an anti sickness um so and which you can get from the pharmacy|day4_consultation06_doctor_u58
um and you also to drink uh sugary and carbonated drinks something like coke|day4_consultation06_doctor_u59
for the three of them is uh is a good sort of cocktail to start them then we can go up the treatment ladder you can get specific migraine relief medication|day4_consultation06_doctor_u60
and that should be something to try between now and when we see you to do the um to do the assessment|day4_consultation06_doctor_u61
assessment to where we can see you today at some point|day4_consultation06_doctor_u62
and but however if you do take these medications and you know by the time your appointment time comes in and you feel much better in yourself you can cancel it um you can give us a call and cancel it|day4_consultation06_doctor_u63
ok|day4_consultation06_doctor_u64
uh any any questions for me|day4_consultation06_doctor_u65
all right ok um any any further problems between now and your appointment please do let us know|day4_consultation06_doctor_u66

and your vision has been blurry as well is that right is that is that on both eyes or just in left left eye|day1_consultation03_doctor_u17

how long did it last for|day1_consultation03_doctor_u24

yeah|day1_consultation03_doctor_u26
yeah yeah|day1_consultation03_doctor_u28
yeah yeah|day1_consultation03_doctor_u29
yeah sure i mean i can see your concern obviously is a lot there's a lot of worry there|day1_consultation03_doctor_u31
um but you know let let let as i said let's take it step by step um to see exactly what the cause of these headaches are first um i'm just going to ask you some um very uh yes no questions if that's ok ma'am um|day1_consultation03_doctor_u32
um have you noticed any problems with your speech at all any difficulties with your words|day1_consultation03_doctor_u33
any problems with your arms and legs for example numbness or weakness|day1_consultation03_doctor_u34
any difficulty with balance your balance or coordination|day1_consultation03_doctor_u35
ok and have you had any injuries to your head have you had a fall recently or been knocked on the head|day1_consultation03_doctor_u36
ok alright um and and you're feeling otherwise ok so for example your um|day1_consultation03_doctor_u37
uh your your breathing's ok you're not feeling breathless or|day1_consultation03_doctor_u38
no ok um do you have any other medical history i should be aware of|day1_consultation03_doctor_u39
no so for example have you had has anyone told you you've had migraines in the past|day1_consultation03_doctor_u40
no ok do you|day1_consultation03_doctor_u41
ok|day1_consultation03_doctor_u42
right my next question was that of family history is there anything in the family so apart from migraines is there anything else is there anything related to brain for example|day1_consultation03_doctor_u43
what was that sorry|day1_consultation03_doctor_u44
thyroid as well ok um ok any other problems with for example the brain or um you mentioned brain cancer any other family history of|day1_consultation03_doctor_u45
no ok um in terms of medications do you take anything on a regular basis|day1_consultation03_doctor_u46
ok and how long have you been on that for|day1_consultation03_doctor_u47
three months ok and is that mainly for contraception or is that for something else|day1_consultation03_doctor_u48
ok alright|day1_consultation03_doctor_u49
that's something you meant to have a little discussion about today as well um|day1_consultation03_doctor_u50
uh well my next question was about um your social your situation at home you mentioned you work in the fashion industry|day1_consultation03_doctor_u51
and your work is your job quite stressful at the moment|day1_consultation03_doctor_u52
have you been|day1_consultation03_doctor_u53
is it getting you down|day1_consultation03_doctor_u54
ok alright and what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress normally|day1_consultation03_doctor_u55
ok do you do much in the way of exercise|day1_consultation03_doctor_u56
no ok um who's at home with you|day1_consultation03_doctor_u57
ok um are you coping ok at the moment|day1_consultation03_doctor_u58
yeah ok um do you smoke at all and do you drink much in the way of alcohol|day1_consultation03_doctor_u59
ok alright um so normally at this i'd like to kind of proceed to examination um|day1_consultation03_doctor_u60
that's um based on your story um i wonder whether you may uh may have a migraine uh migraine type headache uh it sounds|day1_consultation03_doctor_u61
um very classical of that of that nature the the the headache on one side throbbing nature the nausea vomiting um sensitivity to bright lights|day1_consultation03_doctor_u62
uh i'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious such as meningitis or indeed|day1_consultation03_doctor_u63
brain cancer i know that was a big worry of yours initially um|day1_consultation03_doctor_u64
yeah yeah|day1_consultation03_doctor_u65
well i hope that puts your you know mind at ease um certainly this is the second migraine you've had in the space of a month um|day1_consultation03_doctor_u66
so i think moving forwards there's a couple of options i think keeping a headache diary would be quite important uh to see exactly what's triggering these headaches|day1_consultation03_doctor_u67
and in terms of trying to treat your headaches today some strong painkillers would be advisable so think about paracetamol or even co codamol|day1_consultation03_doctor_u68
um and some anti inflammatories such as ibuprofen and naproxen how's that sound to you|day1_consultation03_doctor_u69
um and uh you know if your headaches were to become more persistent then we could maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the first place something prophylactic medicines|day1_consultation03_doctor_u70
then we could have a discussion next time i see you next week perhaps|day1_consultation03_doctor_u71
ok um now a couple of things i want you to think about is you know if your symptoms aren't getting better next two three days or indeed they're getting worse|day1_consultation03_doctor_u72
i'd like you to come back and see me um straight away if possible so if your headache's getting worse not responding to medications|day1_consultation03_doctor_u73
or your um neck pain is getting worse or you develop any weakness in your arms and legs or your vision then i want you to come back and see me straight away ok|day1_consultation03_doctor_u74
does that sound all ok|day1_consultation03_doctor_u75
great any questions for me|day1_consultation03_doctor_u76
ok have a good day|day1_consultation03_doctor_u77
right|day1_consultation03_doctor_u78
hi|day5_consultation03_patient_u0
yeah uh my name is valerie cole my date of birth is the nineteenth of september nineteen ninety three|day5_consultation03_patient_u1
my address is uh sixty four cliveden place in south wimbledon|day5_consultation03_patient_u2
yes i am yeah|day5_consultation03_patient_u3
um i've been feeling really anxious over the past few months um i just get really nervous every morning about leaving the house and it's started to really worry me and just add up and build up on that anxiety and i just didn't know who to talk to or so i wanted to check with my gp|day5_consultation03_patient_u4
um i guess so i think um i would say maybe about two months or so i've been feeling like this and that probably coincides with me starting a new job um|day5_consultation03_patient_u5
which i i would say it's quite i mean every job is stressful and when you first start but it's been really stressful i think over the past two months definitely|day5_consultation03_patient_u6
um so i work for a a a fashion retailer in um the head office team and it's just a brand new sector i've never worked in retail before my boss is not very nice to me and i don't|day5_consultation03_patient_u7
but i also think that it's just been i just really dread going there i just hate speaking to her i hate like seeing everyone and really worried about whether i'm doing well or not|day5_consultation03_patient_u8
and it's really impacting on like on the rest of my life like my sleep and stuff like that|day5_consultation03_patient_u9
right|day5_consultation03_patient_u10
yeah this is really so i i i've as i say like i don't want to go to work in the morning so i just find no way of i can't get out of bed|day5_consultation03_patient_u11
but it's also because when i leave i just when i've left work i just feel so stressed and so worried about everything i've done i can't get to sleep for hours and hours and hours so i|day5_consultation03_patient_u12
about ten eleven probably|day5_consultation03_patient_u13
not for ages i'm i'm lying awake all night|day5_consultation03_patient_u14
mmm|day5_consultation03_patient_u15
so i find my my heart kind of racing and then i'm just like panicking that i'm gonna be late and that that's gonna make work even more stressful so i do have an alarm but i find myself waking up before that 'cause i'm just my heart is racing and actually the other day i was just like i was lying in bed and i really thought my heart was racing so much i thought i was gonna have a heart attack in the morning|day5_consultation03_patient_u16
i just i can't even tell because i feel like i'm even when i'm in sleep it's such a shallow sleep but maybe three four hours i'm getting now|day5_consultation03_patient_u17
probably not significant changes maybe no i wouldn't say that i wouldn't say that i'm eating like much differently ohh that i probably have more chocolate than normal just because i feel so down|day5_consultation03_patient_u18
yeah|day5_consultation03_patient_u19
yeah so um it's it's usually kind of like when i realise in the morning that either um i feel like i'm gonna be late because i've like overslept 'cause i'm so tired|day5_consultation03_patient_u20
um or i wake up in a panic thinking i am gonna be late so it's just kind of like just a constant like rapid heart beating it's just really really stressful i don't know if it's stress or if or i did think it was like a heart problem really actually|day5_consultation03_patient_u21
irregular i think|day5_consultation03_patient_u22
ohh it can be anything i think couple of minutes or the other day i was actually just sort of lying there for like holding my hand on my chest for like ten minutes|day5_consultation03_patient_u23
yeah but i would say this is only in the past sort of like couple of months as i say that i've been experiencing this|day5_consultation03_patient_u24
no um well yeah it's painful to when the heart when my heart is beating fast but but yeah|day5_consultation03_patient_u25
it's just really really low i mean i i'm finding now that i'm just i find no enjoyment at all|day5_consultation03_patient_u26
it's kind of day to day and anything that i'm doing it's not just my job it's you know when i leave i'm just so tired that anything that previously was really fun is just not it's not enjoyable and i'm like yeah on edge the whole time|day5_consultation03_patient_u27
well right now i'm i'm working so late and everything is really really stressful so i don't really get much time to myself but when i do wanna go out or you know see friends or just relax it it seems quite difficult to do that|day5_consultation03_patient_u28
i avoid them insomuch that i feel like i'm|day5_consultation03_patient_u29
yeah so i mean sometimes it just i know that i'm not gonna have fun because i don't want to go out and do things that i would normally have done|day5_consultation03_patient_u30
yeah as i say like everything that i had previously been doing has been just difficult to continue with like i did used to like to like go running and|day5_consultation03_patient_u31
and to play tennis and stuff but now it's just not i'm just not enjoying it i'm not i'm not like i'm not going out to do that quite so much|day5_consultation03_patient_u32
no 'cause i think that would just add to the tension but i do like pretty much every morning i think ohh i should call in sick or like just not go|day5_consultation03_patient_u33
um|day5_consultation03_patient_u34
no i wouldn't say so i think i've always managed to make it to work|day5_consultation03_patient_u35
but i i wonder if it's building up so this is why i wanted to call i'm just worried it's building up to that and i don't know what to do 'cause i have feel it felt it get worse and worse over the past couple of months|day5_consultation03_patient_u36
yeah i mean i find public transport really stressful anyway especially being on the tube it's 'cause it's quite getting warmer so it's just really airless|day5_consultation03_patient_u37
um but i think the majority of it 'cause my life is just so focused around work right now the majority of it is focused around work as well|day5_consultation03_patient_u38
not really i i'm no i would say i mean everybody always has a bit of tension a bit of anxiety but i've never felt anything this bad before|day5_consultation03_patient_u39
yeah|day5_consultation03_patient_u40
um i mean yeah yeah 'cause i do yeah i'm pretty much down like i don't enjoy being and not just my day at all 'cause|day5_consultation03_patient_u41
i'm just so worried about everything um and i find that even when i'm not like even at the weekends and stuff it's just the kind of like constant feeling of just being a bit down a bit unhappy|day5_consultation03_patient_u42
um|day5_consultation03_patient_u43
i don't know that's a good question i can't really i can't really put a on that at all|day5_consultation03_patient_u44
i wouldn't no i wouldn't say that i've had i haven't had any suicidal thoughts or any thoughts that have been that extreme like i haven't|day5_consultation03_patient_u45
you know i have i have a good support system like i do have good family and stuff so i i have i don't have uh worries about actually wanting to um not go on it's just that i don't wanna go on like this|day5_consultation03_patient_u46
sorry|day5_consultation03_patient_u47
yeah i live with my parents just my parents|day5_consultation03_patient_u48
um ooh i don't know probably quite a lot on the friday or saturday just because that that's kind of normal um|day5_consultation03_patient_u49
uh maybe i maybe i do have like a bit during the week like my parents obviously are retired so they just drink whenever they want so whenever they're having a glass of wine they'll offer it to me and it's like i guess i don't really keep track of it that much|day5_consultation03_patient_u50
probably like probably quite a lot on a friday or saturday because it's usually going out so maybe like|day5_consultation03_patient_u51
i probably go over my limit just on those days anyway and then like maybe a glass of wine during the week|day5_consultation03_patient_u52
um i try not to smoke but i do occasionally but i don't take drugs|day5_consultation03_patient_u53
i well i talk to my mum because she also suffers from well she's suffered from like depression in the past i didn't think that it was that i was suffering from actual depression because it just seems to be manifesting as as total as just stress the whole time|day5_consultation03_patient_u54
but um i did talk to my mum about it but i haven't sought any she recommended that i come to the gp um but i haven't sought any other|day5_consultation03_patient_u55

fluid is probably best but i am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins um so you can get things like diarolyte which is um a fluid replacement you can get from the pharmacy it's probably worth uh recommending that|day1_consultation11_doctor_u55
no you can just get that over the counter|day1_consultation11_doctor_u56
um you can try just you know regular paracetamol if you are feeling feverish but if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days so forty eight hours i want you to give me a call back|day1_consultation11_doctor_u57
because um you know if you are getting dehydrated then we need to do further investigations ok but i think let's let's see how you are in the next one to two days|day1_consultation11_doctor_u58
and uh we'll catch up soon ok|day1_consultation11_doctor_u59
clear fluids you can use soft diet things like soup mash and then gradually build up um as much as your body can tolerate|day1_consultation11_doctor_u60
um but let's try and keep yourself well hydrated first ok|day1_consultation11_doctor_u61
absolutely if you are having if you've got a bit of tummy pain if you're feeling feverish then i think paracetamol is very sensible|day1_consultation11_doctor_u62
ok try and avoid alcohol if you can|day1_consultation11_doctor_u63
ok alright then|day1_consultation11_doctor_u64
thank you for your help|day1_consultation11_doctor_u65
thank you bye bye now|day1_consultation11_doctor_u66

i mean there was just like there was one thing i think just 'cause i can panic and you can look online get a bit frantic|day2_consultation03_patient_u38
i guess what i'm trying to think is you know is there something particularly serious that you know will need to be sorted and|day2_consultation03_patient_u39

which one did you take|day2_consultation08_doctor_u32
was it a weekly tablet or a daily tablet|day2_consultation08_doctor_u33
ok um and was it one tablet or was it another one that you would take on top of the first one|day2_consultation08_doctor_u34
ok|day2_consultation08_doctor_u35

right ok um thank you for sharing that with me now do you have um any other illnesses at all in the past|day2_consultation08_doctor_u39
and that back pain have you um have you seen anyone about that|day2_consultation08_doctor_u40
have they have they give you any kind of diagnosis at all|day2_consultation08_doctor_u41
alright um are there any illnesses in your family at all|day2_consultation08_doctor_u42
i'm sorry to hear that um how old was he when that happened|day2_consultation08_doctor_u43
ok um are you on any medication at all|day2_consultation08_doctor_u44
ok uh do you have any allergies at all medication|day2_consultation08_doctor_u45
ok so hay fever|day2_consultation08_doctor_u46
alright um are you um you're working at the moment|day2_consultation08_doctor_u47
what do you work at|day2_consultation08_doctor_u48
ok all right um and um you're up to date with all the vaccinations hepatitis b and that kind of thing|day2_consultation08_doctor_u49
ok|day2_consultation08_doctor_u50
so i can|day2_consultation08_doctor_u51
sure ok um and are you a uh are you a smoker at all|day2_consultation08_doctor_u52
ok and ohh do you drink much alcohol|day2_consultation08_doctor_u53
ok and how much kind of physical exercise do you do normally|day2_consultation08_doctor_u54
ok that's good alright um so um|day2_consultation08_doctor_u55
what uh i think we're gonna need to do is we're gonna need to bring you into one of our clinics examine and we're gonna need to arrange some blood tests as well|day2_consultation08_doctor_u56
ok um so what what i want to do is the first question i have in my mind is that we need to find a reason for why you've got this fever and these symptoms because there's no apparent reason from what you've told me|day2_consultation08_doctor_u57
there's no uh when someone has got fever and sweats we want to find out have they got chest infection have they got a throat infection|day2_consultation08_doctor_u58
um and if we can't find a focus of infection then that's something that that's an outstanding question that needs to be answered ok|day2_consultation08_doctor_u59
um the second thing second factor is that you've recently come from uh vietnam|day2_consultation08_doctor_u60
and you've had exposure to rural areas and we need to think about things like malaria or other exotic infections as well so um you're probably gonna need some blood tests|day2_consultation08_doctor_u61
after you've been seen by somebody|day2_consultation08_doctor_u62
um now the urgency of those blood tests depends partly on what we find when we examine you which is why we're going to go go for the examination first|day2_consultation08_doctor_u63
you come into one of our clinics in central london that's one option and then the the gp there who examines you can then decide on how urgent the blood tests and things are going to be|day2_consultation08_doctor_u64
or if it's inconvenient for you to come into central london because you you're living further out you could actually just attend a local a and e|day2_consultation08_doctor_u65
i'm going to type up what my thought process is and what kind of test i think you need in the notes for this appointment so you could show that to them at reception|day2_consultation08_doctor_u66
um i'll be asking for something called thick and thin blood films to check for malaria|day2_consultation08_doctor_u67
and inflammatory markers and things like those technical terms but they'll understand what that what i'm talking about|day2_consultation08_doctor_u68
but um i i don't think you can go into work uh until we've sorted this out and we we we need to sort this out sooner rather than later|day2_consultation08_doctor_u69
ok|day2_consultation08_doctor_u70
ok fine so what i'm going to do is i will send a message to one of our admin team members asking them to book you in|day2_consultation08_doctor_u71
and if you can ring the number that i leave in your consultation notes after a few minutes and then they'll slot you in and then we can sort things out from there ok|day2_consultation08_doctor_u72
alright then ok take care then all the best|day2_consultation08_doctor_u73

ok|day1_consultation11_patient_u5
um so um my name is uh dan choudhry i am seven twenty seven|day1_consultation11_patient_u6
um so i've just um been having some troubles basically in the uh i guess it's been a little while now and i've just been feeling not so great and|day1_consultation11_patient_u7
it's all come from like uh it's like basically i think it's diarrhoea and it's like just coming out like loads of it like i go to the toilet and it's just super watery and it|day1_consultation11_patient_u8
yeah it doesn't feel very solid it so it just it's just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out and it's uh|day1_consultation11_patient_u9
yeah it's just uh not not been very pleasant and like i just it just kind of hasn't doesn't feel like it's getting better so|day1_consultation11_patient_u10
um so i think it was a few when i think about it|day1_consultation11_patient_u11
so monday tuesday i i so i think it was about three it's been about three days now|day1_consultation11_patient_u12
um so i i feel like it's like almost every hour when i'm awake|day1_consultation11_patient_u13
um so sorry|day1_consultation11_patient_u14
yeah so i mean i'm i'm trying to drink a lot of water|day1_consultation11_patient_u15
but um yeah it's just quite a lot and|day1_consultation11_patient_u16
uh it's yeah i i i think i i feel like it's just just fluids coming out|day1_consultation11_patient_u17
um|day1_consultation11_patient_u18
so i no i don't i don't remember anything like no i i think it's just i nothing like that there's nothing like that|day1_consultation11_patient_u19
yeah i mean i it i feel i feel a cramp|day1_consultation11_patient_u20
and then and then i know it's time to go right so around every hour i just feel something come up and then i have to go so yeah i mean that's that's the kind of the first sign|day1_consultation11_patient_u21
it's kind of if i think about it it's like it's like at the bottom uh i don't know if that makes sense um|day1_consultation11_patient_u22
um i i think it it it feels pretty like in the middle to me not on any side left or right|day1_consultation11_patient_u23
um it it comes and goes it comes and goes|day1_consultation11_patient_u24
ok so like|day1_consultation11_patient_u25
um|day1_consultation11_patient_u26
so|day1_consultation11_patient_u28
what do you mean by uh pain so i i think it's maybe a|day1_consultation11_patient_u29
i i guess so i'm when i think about it like when i get it i can pretend that i don't feel it so i can still sit down and|day1_consultation11_patient_u30
uh i can still like cover it up and people don't really notice so i i don't know what that means but maybe is that like a six or a seven|day1_consultation11_patient_u31
ok|day1_consultation11_patient_u32
um yeah i definitely i definitely feel kind of nauseous um|day1_consultation11_patient_u33
like i and like i've have vomited and when i like i think it's maybe something to do with like whenever i have like milk or something like that i just feel like i want to vomit and actually yeah one time i just like had some milk and i just completely vomited it|day1_consultation11_patient_u34
um i've been i've been trying to avoid it but um yeah|day1_consultation11_patient_u35
um sorry could you repeat that|day1_consultation11_patient_u36
uh no no it's not|day1_consultation11_patient_u37
um so i yeah i think i am pretty i feel kind of really hot all the time and uh i'm pretty sure i'm burning up i haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that but it's i yeah i've i've sure i'm i'm not a like not a normal temperature|day1_consultation11_patient_u38
um yeah a bit i guess less frequently maybe um but yeah it seems to be ok|day1_consultation11_patient_u39
um so i so my um my brother has had actually had something like this for um he has it as well for five days as well um and i i've i'm not yeah i i can't think of what what the trigger is for me i mean my brother normally can deal deals with this stuff a lot better than me but yeah i that's why|day1_consultation11_patient_u40
um|day1_consultation11_patient_u41
he so he's been like this for five days i think he's getting better but i'm not i'm not really sure he said he said he had he's had something for a little while as well|day1_consultation11_patient_u42
um so it just feels like the the fluids do go down but it just feels like it's going straight through|day1_consultation11_patient_u43
it just feels like it's going straight through|day1_consultation11_patient_u44
um so i had some i mean i had some lunch today um|day1_consultation11_patient_u45

yeah i mean i i'm an ok weight and um i i can't think of any related medical history|day1_consultation11_patient_u48
um i mean like my yeah i no i i don't think so|day1_consultation11_patient_u49

and i don't know what's causing them i have googled it and um nothing's coming up so i thought i'd come and speak to you about it|day2_consultation05_patient_u7
so it started with feeling very tired but for a couple of days and then i get back to normal|day2_consultation05_patient_u8
and then i started losing feeling in my hands and arms i get a weird sensation like uh i guess pins and needles|day2_consultation05_patient_u9
and|day2_consultation05_patient_u10
yeah that's correct|day2_consultation05_patient_u11
my right hand|day2_consultation05_patient_u12

yes that's fine|day2_consultation05_patient_u14
uh the pins and needles are in the hand but i feel like my arm is getting weaker but it only lasts few days and then goes back to normal so it's very weird|day2_consultation05_patient_u15
uh my colleague said i'm walking slightly differently to normal|day2_consultation05_patient_u16
and again it's only for three days or three or four days|day2_consultation05_patient_u17

uh where are we now we've just started april i definitely christmas new year i felt relatively well i think|day5_consultation09_patient_u6
um so since then actually yeah i i was on holiday in um in the states and yeah it probably coincided with some time around then end of january start of feb|day5_consultation09_patient_u7

yeah had a had a great time very active uh|day5_consultation09_patient_u9

no the symptoms sort of all started afterwards|day5_consultation09_patient_u11
uh no|day5_consultation09_patient_u12
uh i don't think so like i'm probably less hungry but no no weight change just a bit|day5_consultation09_patient_u13
uh yeah probably slightly smaller portions or it yeah more of an effort to to actually eat everything that's in front of me|day5_consultation09_patient_u14

uh i think sort of calf back of my calf because i didn't notice it my wife noticed it actually|day5_consultation09_patient_u20
um probably uh around the end of february the middle to end of feb and then it like it didn't actually cause too much itching or anything at the time and i it faded over a couple of weeks i guess|day5_consultation09_patient_u21
um i to be honest that actually turns out it was a bit of a sore throat i had um so possibly a little bit feverish but i i sort of put it down to that|day5_consultation09_patient_u22
uh i like i do quite a lot of walking and we did um quite a lot while we were out in the on holiday as well but definitely um|day5_consultation09_patient_u23
yeah i mean i don't i don't recall any bugs i don't remember seeing anything bitten but you often like yeah as you're walking through i was in shorts and and boots but|day5_consultation09_patient_u24
um just sort of um he examined me so|day5_consultation09_patient_u25

oops sorry you broke up a bit there|day5_consultation09_patient_u60
ohh no not no|day5_consultation09_patient_u61
ok take care thank you bye|day5_consultation09_patient_u62
hi there good morning|day2_consultation01_doctor_u0
uh i'm dr dean mesa from babylon|day2_consultation01_doctor_u1
can you hear me ok|day2_consultation01_doctor_u2
yeah ok great well nice to see you this morning um before we start your appointment could i confirm your full name and date of birth please|day2_consultation01_doctor_u3
that's perfect thank you john um are you in a private place where you're ok to speak at the moment|day2_consultation01_doctor_u4
ok great so um tell me what's been going on you've been saying there's a problem with your hearing is that right|day2_consultation01_doctor_u5
right ok how long has this been going on for|day2_consultation01_doctor_u6
six weeks ok um and before that have you had any hearing problem at all|day2_consultation01_doctor_u7
right ok ok and um in this six week period have you had anything else happen have you had any other ear symptoms at all|day2_consultation01_doctor_u8
right ok uh uh um just to clarify the difficulty you've got in hearing is that both ears or just the left ear|day2_consultation01_doctor_u9
alright so your right ear is fine|day2_consultation01_doctor_u10
ok so you've had ringing difficulty hearing in your left ear and feeling slightly sick|day2_consultation01_doctor_u11
um that's been on and off for the six weeks or is it continuous there throughout that six weeks|day2_consultation01_doctor_u12
right ok um and um have you had any pain from the ear at all|day2_consultation01_doctor_u13
ok any discharge coming out of the ear no ok um have have you been experiencing any fever|day2_consultation01_doctor_u14
right ok and um has your ear been itchy at all|day2_consultation01_doctor_u15
ok now do you use cotton ball buds to try and clean out wax from your ears|day2_consultation01_doctor_u16
no ok well you're right you should you shouldn't be doing that doesn't clean up wax it pushes it back in alright um the first thing that we need to do is we need to get someone to have a look inside your ear|day2_consultation01_doctor_u17
'k i'm just exclude the simple things simple things might be wax you know someone might have impacted wax blocking the tube going into the eardrum which can|day2_consultation01_doctor_u18
lead to muffled hearing um if that's the case that that's something that's easy fixable but um so we need to exclude that first|day2_consultation01_doctor_u19
and then after that we can consider other potential possibilities um and for that we need to have a look inside the ear drum|day2_consultation01_doctor_u20
so um what i think we could do is um maybe if we book you in for a face to face appointment in one of our clinics it's not an emergency|day2_consultation01_doctor_u21
it can be done within the next four five days or so ok and then um what i'll do i'll send a message to our admin team|day2_consultation01_doctor_u22
i'll ask them to slot you into the clinic one of our clinics in that time frame you can come in and one of the gps will just have a quick look in the ear and figure out|day2_consultation01_doctor_u23
whether there's physical blockage or whether there's something else going on ok um can i just double check the dizziness that you've been getting um how severe is it|day2_consultation01_doctor_u24
right right ok have have you had any chest pain with it|day2_consultation01_doctor_u26
no any palpitations heart beating fast|day2_consultation01_doctor_u27
ok fine alright um so let's get your ear checked out i think that will be the the most sensible thing to do and then after that we can we'll be a step closer to figuring out which way we|day2_consultation01_doctor_u28
it might be that there's a problem inside the drum or the balance system within the ear but we just need to exclude whether there's|day2_consultation01_doctor_u29
physical blockage first and trying to deal with that if that's the case ok um but|day2_consultation01_doctor_u30
the ringing that you got that you've got it's something called tinnitus ok um|day2_consultation01_doctor_u31
and tinnitus is something actually that medicine doctors we don't really understand it fully we haven't|day2_consultation01_doctor_u32
uh people can't give you a specific cause for why some patients get tinnitus and some patients don't it can be triggered by a wide range of different things and in fact|day2_consultation01_doctor_u33
i'm glad that you've mentioned that what i might do in the time between now and when you come for the appointment i'm going to uh put|day2_consultation01_doctor_u34
paste the link for a leaflet about tinnitus um in the notes for this appointment i'd really appreciate it if you could start reading about it|day2_consultation01_doctor_u35
ok and often that that uh awareness of what it is and what the treatment options are and there are limited options|day2_consultation01_doctor_u36
um that helps us in terms of conversation about what we do next if your ear is clear ok so um i'm going to paste a link to that um and you can read about that and|day2_consultation01_doctor_u37
what we'll do is we'll see you in about four five days time it won't be with me it'll be another gp|day2_consultation01_doctor_u38
but they'll have my notes and they'll know exactly what what my question is which is just to check your ears is that ok|day2_consultation01_doctor_u39
alright great so um bear with me five minutes and then you can ring the support team i'll leave the number in the notes for this appointment ring them and then they'll slot you in ok|day2_consultation01_doctor_u40

ok and when do you think it last when do you think that asthma stopped at what age did you get to a point where you weren't taking medication anymore|day5_consultation08_doctor_u16
and so this time how did it start did you have any other symptoms any chest pain temperature cold symptoms anything like that|day5_consultation08_doctor_u18

have you been woken up at night time at all|day5_consultation08_doctor_u22
have you been able to do any exercise|day5_consultation08_doctor_u23
ok and do you have a peak flow meter at home where you measure your breathing|day5_consultation08_doctor_u24
you have what's called a peak flow meter which you breathe into to get a score on your breathing|day5_consultation08_doctor_u25
and do you normally take any asthma inhalers over the last few years|day5_consultation08_doctor_u26
you do so you said you stopped them three to four years ago|day5_consultation08_doctor_u27
ok how about over the last three to four years|day5_consultation08_doctor_u28
have you taken any medication|day5_consultation08_doctor_u29
ok so you you normally take that do you or is that just recently|day5_consultation08_doctor_u30
ok and how often do you normally need it|day5_consultation08_doctor_u31
ok what about when you exercise normally do you have to use medication uh inhalers|day5_consultation08_doctor_u32
pardon|day5_consultation08_doctor_u33
ok um and do you take any other medications|day5_consultation08_doctor_u34
any other medical problems|day5_consultation08_doctor_u35
ok do you take anything for that|day5_consultation08_doctor_u36
and any allergies to medications|day5_consultation08_doctor_u37
do you smoke|day5_consultation08_doctor_u38
do you drink any alcohol regularly|day5_consultation08_doctor_u39
how often have a glass of what|day5_consultation08_doctor_u40
every how often did you say|day5_consultation08_doctor_u41
and who do you live with at home|day5_consultation08_doctor_u42
who do you live with at home|day5_consultation08_doctor_u43
who do you live with do you live on your own or do you live with|day5_consultation08_doctor_u44
ok and what's your job day to day|day5_consultation08_doctor_u45
and have you been at work in the last few days|day5_consultation08_doctor_u46
ok and when at the moment are you um feeling short of breath when you're sitting still or just when you walk|day5_consultation08_doctor_u47
are you able to get up and down the stairs ok|day5_consultation08_doctor_u48
right ok um and did you say you were finding it hard to complete your sentences|day5_consultation08_doctor_u49
ok um|day5_consultation08_doctor_u50
right ok um i mean it sounds like you've had a flare up of your asthma it could be um triggered by if there's more pollen around or there may be you may have a viral infection causing it to get worse|day5_consultation08_doctor_u51
did you say you checked your temperature already|day5_consultation08_doctor_u52
was it normal|day5_consultation08_doctor_u53
what was your temperature|day5_consultation08_doctor_u54
ok that's fine um have you got an asthma inhaler at home|day5_consultation08_doctor_u55
ok so what i would suggest is you take it more regularly than you are doing at the moment have you got um a spacer at home|day5_consultation08_doctor_u56
um do you have a spacer at home|day5_consultation08_doctor_u57
ok um what i can do is i can prescribe you a peak flow meter so we can check your breathing level and a spacer to use your inhaler a bit more efficiently which the pharmacist can show you how you use that when you pick it up|day5_consultation08_doctor_u58
um and if you increase it so you're taking it two to four puffs like every four hours|day5_consultation08_doctor_u59
initially um if you get a high temperature or your wheezing is getting worse you need to call us back straightaway so we can just advise you further with that|day5_consultation08_doctor_u60
and it will be a good idea when you're feeling better if we can arrange just a review just to see how your asthma is because we may need to start some other medication for you|day5_consultation08_doctor_u61
you could arrange a review in a week or so um but but before that and if you're if you're feeling worse|day5_consultation08_doctor_u62
ok and the other thing to do would be to take a regular antihistamine|day5_consultation08_doctor_u63
which you can get from the pharmacy i can put a on your notes about what to take|day5_consultation08_doctor_u64
and then if you when you get the peak flow meter if you can take the pharmacist can show you how to use it and if you can record a value first thing when you wake up|day5_consultation08_doctor_u65
and in the evening over the next week and then we can discuss that over the phone when we look at the figures and see whether you need to go on another inhaler as well|day5_consultation08_doctor_u66
have you got any questions|day5_consultation08_doctor_u67
thanks a lot bye|day5_consultation08_doctor_u68

sure yeah ok but you're not short of breath at rest at the moment|day4_consultation09_doctor_u40
ok fine so what what i think um and just to just to go over is there anything you had hoped about getting other than the uh a prescription for your inhalers was there anything else you'd hoped about getting from this|day4_consultation09_doctor_u41
sure yeah no absolutely well i'm really glad you have talked to me today i think what we can do is is give you a prescription for uh some more of the inhalers we can get that to you within the hour i would hope|day4_consultation09_doctor_u42
um and uh i think what the other thing i'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids so this is these are tablets which um you can take for five days uh two tablets in the morning|day4_consultation09_doctor_u43
and uh that should just dampen down your asthmatic response ok|day4_consultation09_doctor_u44
um now there are some side effects to the steroids which i should really tell you about but please read the label that's associated with don't be too worried about the side effects|day4_consultation09_doctor_u45
they're most you know most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated and uh you have you had them in the past do you know of|day4_consultation09_doctor_u46
have you had steroids in the past|day4_consultation09_doctor_u47
probably yeah i would too so um they they can come they can make you your mood change can be slightly low or too slightly high|day4_consultation09_doctor_u48
can give you a high blood sugar um and uh their uh they can also cause rash nausea um headaches but mostly is well tolerated and it should help your asthma an awful lot|day4_consultation09_doctor_u49
um uh what i'd like to do is is send you these the some prescriptions for your uh inhalers ongoing so you um you can once you get better from this asthma attack you can you can use the clenil modulite in the morning with ventolin as a prn so a ventolin when you need to um when you're getting wheezy|day4_consultation09_doctor_u50
if you should start to use the ventolin more than uh every three hours|day4_consultation09_doctor_u51
uh at at anytime it's a good idea to seek medical attention so um see a doctor um in some capacity|day4_consultation09_doctor_u52
uh and the other thing i'd like to send you is a spacer which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better have you do you know what a spacer is have you used one before|day4_consultation09_doctor_u53
have you got one|day4_consultation09_doctor_u54
ok all right well um i'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it but essentially uh couple of puffs to prime it inside breathing in and out um uh for five or five or ten breaths|day4_consultation09_doctor_u55
uh yeah so|day4_consultation09_doctor_u56
uh was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about at this stage|day4_consultation09_doctor_u57
ok and and uh i might give you some time off work as well you can self certify first seven days but uh i think i would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better if you're ok with that all right|day4_consultation09_doctor_u58
ok no worries any deterioration in your symptoms like worsening shortness of breath um or just generally concerning symptoms uh pain in your chest tightness uh feeling light headed|day4_consultation09_doctor_u59
uh then seek further medical attention anytime please ok|day4_consultation09_doctor_u60

ok i i've really not been feeling so well at all recently i i've been struggling with fever for the past week yeah i would say it's about seven days ago i'm just i'm really hot and sweaty all the time and just generally not feeling good|day2_consultation08_patient_u4
um i'd say that i'm aching all over really my muscles are really aching i'm feeling quite nauseous uh so i've not been able to eat very much and i have been drinking but it's been quite a small amount|day2_consultation08_patient_u5
um and yeah just generally quite tired and unwell i'm sweating during the the the night i'm quite cold|day2_consultation08_patient_u6
yes yes quite interchangeable not really a pattern to it|day2_consultation08_patient_u7
uh i've been trying to like take ibuprofen and paracetamol just to from over the counter but it's not really helping just been taking the recommended dose every day of those|day2_consultation08_patient_u8
perhaps slightly yes but i'm still experiencing these symptoms so it does take the edge off a bit|day2_consultation08_patient_u9
mmm not those sort of symptoms really um|day2_consultation08_patient_u10
um so i have a habit|day2_consultation08_patient_u11
that it's mainly just the sweating really and the and the nausea uh that's overtaking all all day and uh the aching muscles all over|day2_consultation08_patient_u12
mmm no my ears are fine actually i haven't had any problems with my ears|day2_consultation08_patient_u13
and not not really no not that i can find|day2_consultation08_patient_u14
um no my neck's my neck's been fine|day2_consultation08_patient_u15
not more than usual no just like the general headaches but not just from staring at the screen no migraines or anything|day2_consultation08_patient_u16
uum it's quite centralized over over the head|day2_consultation08_patient_u17
it's something that i've struggled with through years really just related to a screen use or uum like changes in weather patterns yeah high pressure days sometimes i struggle with migraines and headaches|day2_consultation08_patient_u19
uh i haven't noticed any rashes no|day2_consultation08_patient_u20
mmm not really i mean i i often have problems with back pain but not really any other joints|day2_consultation08_patient_u21
any problems|day2_consultation08_patient_u22
uh no there's been no problems there|day2_consultation08_patient_u23
uh not at all no|day2_consultation08_patient_u24
uh i don't think so no it's been fairly regular|day2_consultation08_patient_u25
yes i have actually|day2_consultation08_patient_u26
i went to vietnam uh i came back four weeks ago now|day2_consultation08_patient_u27
i did yes|day2_consultation08_patient_u28
ooo i can't remember now off the top of my head|day2_consultation08_patient_u29
i think it was daily|day2_consultation08_patient_u30
i think it was uh another one that i took on top of the first one|day2_consultation08_patient_u31
it was quite really 'cause we were there for a few weeks and we toured to uh several different parts of the country and uh the countryside and some cities as well|day2_consultation08_patient_u32
i'm sorry could you repeat that i missed that|day2_consultation08_patient_u33
yes it was quite adventurous we were sort of trekking and um cycling uh through the farmland and um seeing how people lived in a day to day life in in in farmland|day2_consultation08_patient_u34
mmm as i said i've i've been struggling with back pain for quite a while but i haven't really had any uh major illnesses in the past i can think of|day2_consultation08_patient_u35
yes yeah i'm under a physiotherapist at the moment for that|day2_consultation08_patient_u36
um they've said that it's uh related to long periods of time sitting at a desk and just uh bad posture so mainly the exercises are focused on improving posture and and to strengthen the muscles in the back|day2_consultation08_patient_u37
hmm the main one would be um heart attack my my father passed away of that|day2_consultation08_patient_u38
in his sixties|day2_consultation08_patient_u39
um sixty eight i think yeah|day2_consultation08_patient_u40
uh just seroxat|day2_consultation08_patient_u41

hi|day3_consultation09_patient_u0
sure my name is mary smith|day3_consultation09_patient_u2
my date of birth is august sixteen nineteen seventy six|day3_consultation09_patient_u3
my email address is mary dot smith at gmail dot com|day3_consultation09_patient_u4
absolutely|day3_consultation09_patient_u5
um well|day3_consultation09_patient_u6
i think that's just like the first thing that i typed but uh uh it wasn't really what i you know i just typed it and then i clicked submit so that was uh um|day3_consultation09_patient_u7
i mean it's part of the problem but i would say that more of a problem for me is that i can't quite move my left arm i mean i can move it but it's it's numb and then i also feel some like tingling in my fingertips|day3_consultation09_patient_u8
yes yes|day3_consultation09_patient_u9
so i've started taking this boxing class i've been taking this boxing class for a few weeks and i feel like maybe um|day3_consultation09_patient_u10
it's probably been i'd say for at least two weeks and it's kind of gotten worse likein the beginning i just kind of felt a little bit of a tingling|day3_consultation09_patient_u11
and then it's gotten it's gotten worse since then then the numbing kind of started i can feel it both in my uh um you know a little bit in my elbow and then in my arm as well as in my hand|day3_consultation09_patient_u12
and now because it hasn't gotten better i tried to get a massage it's not better or you know try to take warm baths it's not better so i figured i'd call you and and just figure out what's going on|day3_consultation09_patient_u13
uh well it's|day3_consultation09_patient_u14
you know it's it's numb and i i kind of looked at stuff online um but you know i i do take ibuprofen because my muscles were sore a little bit and i've been taking this boxing class|day3_consultation09_patient_u15
so you know i kind of hurt like my knuckles on my right hand so that's been a little bit painful so i've just kind of taken ibuprofen for that|day3_consultation09_patient_u16
but like i said i mean i tried massage i tried some hot baths and that didn't help with this numbness thing|day3_consultation09_patient_u17
i'm just kind of getting a little worried|day3_consultation09_patient_u18
and um well it's kind of funny you know sometimes i will feel it in my shoulder like if i try to if i try to like you know move like in boxing and stuff i will even like uh um maybe feel a little bit of a little bit of pain|day3_consultation09_patient_u20
uh but i would say if i'm just like resting if i'm sitting like right now i can feel like it's numb and i i actually feel tingling right now not in all of my fingers just in some|day3_consultation09_patient_u21
ok so it's my second third and fourth finger|day3_consultation09_patient_u22
no it's it's the it's this side so the front side|day3_consultation09_patient_u23
yes|day3_consultation09_patient_u24
so not so much with the glass but i will say um well i play a little bit of a piano and so i just noticed it's been kind of harder to get the notes|day3_consultation09_patient_u25
i can i can grasp i can grasp a a glass but because i use my right hand most of the time you know i'm not left handed so it's kind of hard for me to|day3_consultation09_patient_u26
yes|day3_consultation09_patient_u27
yeah|day3_consultation09_patient_u28
no no it's not hurting it's not hurting it's like numb i can't feel it right well yeah|day3_consultation09_patient_u29
yes absolutely|day3_consultation09_patient_u30
no not no nothing|day3_consultation09_patient_u31
mm hmm|day3_consultation09_patient_u32
well i guess because of this you know i'm not sure if it's boxing i also had a really bad cold like a month ago|day3_consultation09_patient_u33
i mean i was out you know drinking with uh friends um one of our co workers just had his three year anniversary and|day3_consultation09_patient_u34
we kinda went crazy and we were like out partying until you know late hours and i just got uncharacteristically drunk for me and then after that i was sick for probably good like two weeks i was at home i think i must have had some kind of like a flu or something|day3_consultation09_patient_u35
so it's that and then i'd say another weird thing that happened to me a few weeks ago is like i all of a sudden just couldn't see from the uh from my left eye like i i lost some like a little bit of a field of vision|day3_consultation09_patient_u36
uh and but that that just lasted not very long i mean that just lasted maybe for i don't know twenty twenty minutes|day3_consultation09_patient_u37
uh and i kind of thought i don't know maybe it was the the cold you know and the virus and all that so|day3_consultation09_patient_u38
i i guess that's what i can you know that's the last thing i can remember but in general i'm i'm pretty healthy you know i work out uh and i i don't really have any medical problems|day3_consultation09_patient_u39
um sometimes i get headaches but i think they're just tired headaches you know sometimes i'll get kind of|day3_consultation09_patient_u40
tired but i think that's probably because i work too much or you know because like i'll go for a workout and then i'll really just exhaust myself and then i just kind of feel this fatigue|day3_consultation09_patient_u41
uh or sometimes like this morning for example i just felt really fatigued and i couldn't even get myself to the gym but you know since i have this numbness it's kind of like hard to workout right|day3_consultation09_patient_u42
no|day3_consultation09_patient_u43
what's a seizure|day3_consultation09_patient_u44
ohh no no no no nothing like that mmm mmm|day3_consultation09_patient_u45
right exactly|day3_consultation09_patient_u46
yeah yeah yeah walking is normal yeah|day3_consultation09_patient_u47
you know i think it was only maybe like twenty minutes or so it's almost like it happened and i thought ohh my god it's probably i'm still like sick from this you know virus thing cold and so i just kind of slacked it off and then when i uh um when i woke up it was gone|day3_consultation09_patient_u48
not really i just take ibuprofen every once in a while i take vitamin d um i take some i i like my my gp really wants me to take iron supplements but you know they're just like huge pills so i i most of the time i just forget|day3_consultation09_patient_u49
but vitamin d i take and then sometimes i take melatonin to help me sleep|day3_consultation09_patient_u50
i know that my dad has i don't know if it it's hypo i think it's hypothyroidism|day3_consultation09_patient_u51
um and then my like he's got he's got some autoimmune stuff going on like that much i know|day3_consultation09_patient_u52
and then my mom my mom she's actually not in a great shape she's got diabetes type two|day3_consultation09_patient_u53
she's got hypertension um she's got gosh what is it ohh yeah she's got high cholesterol um and i think that's it for her yeah|day3_consultation09_patient_u54
uh|day3_consultation09_patient_u55
ok|day3_consultation09_patient_u58
what do you think may be going on|day3_consultation09_patient_u61

having listened to your story i think you're probably suffering from what we call gastroenteritis uh which essentially is just a a tummy bug it's an infection of your your tummy um and normally lasts about three to five days and gets better|day1_consultation12_doctor_u43
the things you can do to really help yourself get better soon um are you can drink plenty of fluids really try and flush the toxins out of your body|day1_consultation12_doctor_u44
uh you can get things from the pharmacy which is called dioralyte which can help replenish any uh minerals and vitamins you may have lost uh it's called dioralyte um it's it's a it's a type of fluid replacement drink|day1_consultation12_doctor_u45
um you can take some paracetamol if you're feeling feverish and weak|day1_consultation12_doctor_u46
i would probably advise you to continue taking time off work for next day or two until you get better|day1_consultation12_doctor_u47
normally you have to be diarrhea free for about twenty four to forty eight hours before you return back to work|day1_consultation12_doctor_u48

ok bye bye|day1_consultation12_doctor_u54
hello|day3_consultation08_doctor_u0
hi hi i'm doctor jacob and welcome to babylon hello|day3_consultation08_doctor_u1
hi so just before we start is it alright if you could confirm your full name for me please|day3_consultation08_doctor_u2
and your date of birth|day3_consultation08_doctor_u4
k and your email address for me please|day3_consultation08_doctor_u5
ok and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation|day3_consultation08_doctor_u6
ok so you've mentioned on our notes that you're having a bit of a cough and a cold is that correct|day3_consultation08_doctor_u7
is it two to three days or longer|day3_consultation08_doctor_u8
fine|day3_consultation08_doctor_u9
ok so so it started off with a cold did it|day3_consultation08_doctor_u10
ok|day3_consultation08_doctor_u12
important cold yeah|day3_consultation08_doctor_u13
and so about your cough are you bringing up any phlegm at all|day3_consultation08_doctor_u14
ok|day3_consultation08_doctor_u15
you're not bringing up any blood are you|day3_consultation08_doctor_u16
ok are you feeling short of breath at all|day3_consultation08_doctor_u17
yeah so you're not wheezy or rattly noises in your chest|day3_consultation08_doctor_u18
ok um right so what have you taken so far|day3_consultation08_doctor_u19
well you mentioned uh you've come to your normal medications but you've mentioned you've taken some painkillers like would you tell me the names please|day3_consultation08_doctor_u20
paracetamol ok any ibuprofen at all|day3_consultation08_doctor_u21
no ok and also um you mentioned some regular medication unfortunately i don't have your medical complete medical history so if you could tell me what your medications are and what you use them for|day3_consultation08_doctor_u22
lisonopril ok|day3_consultation08_doctor_u23
yeah ok and how long have you been a diabetic for|day3_consultation08_doctor_u24
five six years ok|day3_consultation08_doctor_u25
ok do you monitor your blood sugars at home|day3_consultation08_doctor_u26
ok and how have they been doing at the moment|day3_consultation08_doctor_u27
ok so there's no problems with your blood pressure control at the moment even though you're not ok so that's fine that's absolutely fine and when was the last time you took your blood pressure|day3_consultation08_doctor_u28
this morning and what was it what was the readings like|day3_consultation08_doctor_u29
cool 'cause there's nothing alarming yeah no more ok that's fine ok so that seems all right|day3_consultation08_doctor_u30
ok so um can i hypothetically look into your mouth here|day3_consultation08_doctor_u31
yeah|day3_consultation08_doctor_u32
yeah so uh looking into your mouth|day3_consultation08_doctor_u33
um you know there's just a bit mild redness at the back of your throat um there's no enlarged tonsils can you feel any glands around your neck at all|day3_consultation08_doctor_u34
no no|day3_consultation08_doctor_u35
ok so it looks like it's just a viral infection um because it's just a cold and a cough there's nothing there|day3_consultation08_doctor_u36
and generally if you have things like a chest infection you would have a bit like a wheeze or shortness of breath|day3_consultation08_doctor_u37
so um things that we would recommend is you can use the you know night nurse day nurse it's still ok with your medications yeah so i'm i'm sure that you are a bit wary to use them but it's still ok with your current medication you can still use that might be able to make you feel a bit more better quickly|day3_consultation08_doctor_u38
if there's any change like you're feeling short of breath or be your symptoms are lasting more than three weeks or something|day3_consultation08_doctor_u39
or you're becoming poorly uh things like that then you need to get in touch with us then probably we might need to examine you and especially your chest but i don't think so that's necessary at this point in time|day3_consultation08_doctor_u40
ok any questions at all|day3_consultation08_doctor_u41
ok so just to round up just use the night night nurse day nurse if any change in your symptoms like shortness of breath wheezy or symptoms are lasting more than three weeks then get in touch with us|day3_consultation08_doctor_u42
no no you don't need anything at the moment ok take care then bye bye bye|day3_consultation08_doctor_u43

no problems no problem that's fine anything else sir|day1_consultation07_doctor_u64
right|day1_consultation07_doctor_u65
ok all right and just moving on swiftly sir do you have any allergies at all|day1_consultation07_doctor_u66
just allergies to medications really i'm i'm asking not as opposed to um other things|day1_consultation07_doctor_u67
ok and just very briefly socially sir just it's very important to ask uh you said you live with your wife anyone else at home with you|day1_consultation07_doctor_u69
ok|day1_consultation07_doctor_u70
ok ok and are you yep and are you working at the moment uh yourself|day1_consultation07_doctor_u71
what what do you do at work|day1_consultation07_doctor_u72
pays the bills really um|day1_consultation07_doctor_u75
what what about smoking and alcohol sir|day1_consultation07_doctor_u76
do you you do either|day1_consultation07_doctor_u77
roughly on average how many you would drink a week|day1_consultation07_doctor_u78
well whatever you drink is it beer lager wine spirits|day1_consultation07_doctor_u79
ok ok and what about smoking sir|day1_consultation07_doctor_u80
ohh ok ok|day1_consultation07_doctor_u81
well i wish you all the best on your journey to quit i i highly recommend it um if you can it'll certainly help your health as well um so just to just to summarise i think you know uh based on your story|day1_consultation07_doctor_u82
um yeah i'm not worry i think you know what you essentially have is a bit of a a bit of a viral illness perhaps a bit of a maybe early signs of a flu um|day1_consultation07_doctor_u83
which i think should settle down um really on it's own uh over time um things to you know you you can do help yourself you know stay rested drink plenty of fluids|day1_consultation07_doctor_u84
um if you are if you are feeling hot and cold and sweaty taking regular paracetamol would be beneficial um you mentioned feeling a bit short of breath um i'm a little bit on the edge about giving you antibiotics i don't think you've got a chest infection but what we could think about is giving you a|day1_consultation07_doctor_u85
a script for antibiotics which maybe use in next twenty four to forty eight hours if your symptoms don't get better|day1_consultation07_doctor_u86
yeah|day1_consultation07_doctor_u87
yeah i will yeah i'll i'll give you a script today give it about twenty four to forty eight hours if you feel like you're still feeling breathless and run down i think there's no harm in starting a course of antibiotics something like amoxicillin|day1_consultation07_doctor_u88
one tablet three times a day um uh and if you're still not better by next week come back and see me we can have another look|day1_consultation07_doctor_u89
exactly|day1_consultation07_doctor_u90

ok so you mentioned in our notes that you've got um skin problem if you can tell me a bit more about it please|day3_consultation07_doctor_u6
ok so where is it sore and red|day3_consultation07_doctor_u7
that|day3_consultation07_doctor_u8
elbows ok inside of the elbows yeah|day3_consultation07_doctor_u9
alright area is it very itchy|day3_consultation07_doctor_u10
itchy and dry ok have you had something like this in the past|day3_consultation07_doctor_u11
ok do you think this is similar to your usual eczema or is it worse|day3_consultation07_doctor_u12
yeah but you could be like something similar so on the skin is there any you know any of the patches sore and you mentioned it's quite sore is it weeping is it like watery liquid coming from that area weeping|day3_consultation07_doctor_u13
nothing ok right|day3_consultation07_doctor_u14
yeah so you have cracks over there ok and is there any scratch marks on your on any of the you know areas any scratch marks|day3_consultation07_doctor_u15
no|day3_consultation07_doctor_u16
ok is there any thickened skin like you know where it's the skin's very um thick and darkened areas|day3_consultation07_doctor_u17
ok uh righty ho so you've mentioned you've got a history of eczema so what do you do about it how do you keep it under control|day3_consultation07_doctor_u18
dermal alright and have you been using them recently or not|day3_consultation07_doctor_u20
you use them every day|day3_consultation07_doctor_u21
ok have you ever used steroids in the past for your eczema|day3_consultation07_doctor_u23
you've used steroids before|day3_consultation07_doctor_u25
yeah also you're still using the steroids|day3_consultation07_doctor_u27
which one are you using the steroids what's the name|day3_consultation07_doctor_u28
is it the|day3_consultation07_doctor_u29
ok so is it like the over the counter ones|day3_consultation07_doctor_u30
over the counter hydrocortisone that does that ring a yeah so you're using the hydrocortisone yeah|day3_consultation07_doctor_u31
are you using any antihistamines at all|day3_consultation07_doctor_u32
no no antihistamines ok|day3_consultation07_doctor_u33
right fine otherwise other than those rash you're feeling well in yourself there's no temperature no joint pains yeah no fever|day3_consultation07_doctor_u34
you've tried the antihistamines and it didn't work ok which one did you try|day3_consultation07_doctor_u35
ok so like cetirizine yeah|day3_consultation07_doctor_u36
yeah ok that's fine right ok so from what you're describing|day3_consultation07_doctor_u37
it looks like you know it is quite widespread your eczema|day3_consultation07_doctor_u38
yeah 'cause you're having it all over your chest and hands and things like that um so do you have any allergies to any medication at all|day3_consultation07_doctor_u39
no allergies ok and you don't other than eczema you don't have any other medical condition|day3_consultation07_doctor_u40
mother has migraine and what was the other one i didn't understand|day3_consultation07_doctor_u41
who who has hypothroidism|day3_consultation07_doctor_u42
ok so she has hyperthyroidism ok that's fine right here you mentioned you have asthma so what medications are you using for asthma|day3_consultation07_doctor_u43
the blue inhaler so you don't you don't use it everyday so you just use it on and off yeah|day3_consultation07_doctor_u44
blue inhalers but your breathing's all ok yeah|day3_consultation07_doctor_u45
yeah|day3_consultation07_doctor_u46
sure so what we need to do is obviously you've got as i've mentioned so extensive eczema|day3_consultation07_doctor_u47
what we'll do we need a couple of minutes because to keep your a bit comfortable we'll you would probably need some antihistamines which i'm going to prescribe|day3_consultation07_doctor_u48
also hydrocortisone is a baby steroid that you use for young children you might probably need a bit more stronger one like betnovateor something like that ok|day3_consultation07_doctor_u49
so we'll try that first so i'm going to it's called the antihistamine is called fexofenadine and then we'll try with some betnovate first so it's like very small amount like it's like one fingertip|day3_consultation07_doctor_u50
yeah this much is is enough to cover your palms|day3_consultation07_doctor_u51
and your back of your hands yeah so it's very small amounts so that if you can imagine you can cover with a very small amount the whole body|day3_consultation07_doctor_u52
yeah so use that you you have to use it twice a day for the next couple of weeks|day3_consultation07_doctor_u53
ok if if there's no improvement you need to get back to us or if you have any kind of adverse reaction like an allergic reaction which is unlikely but if it still happens you need to get in touch with us ok|day3_consultation07_doctor_u54
so what we're going to do is we're going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy it looks like boots on the systems is that correct|day3_consultation07_doctor_u55
yeah yes so i'll send it across to boot's and it will be there for collecting|day3_consultation07_doctor_u56
if things are getting worse in the next two weeks call us before hand otherwise wait for two weeks take the medication and the cream|day3_consultation07_doctor_u57
you still need to continue on your emollients like the dermal soap and as well as the diprovate yeah so you still need to use those in the interim any questions at all|day3_consultation07_doctor_u58
ok then you take care then bye bye now|day3_consultation07_doctor_u59

uh it came like kind of suddenly|day4_consultation06_patient_u8
well i had the kidney stone so let's say that that's ten um i have now maybe five well six six probably|day4_consultation06_patient_u9

sorry|day4_consultation06_patient_u11
um well not really|day4_consultation06_patient_u12
like this i yeah like this no definitely it's something new|day4_consultation06_patient_u13

my vision is quite blurred um it it's it's really weird like some zigzag lines|day4_consultation06_patient_u15
kind of i don't know how to describe it properly|day4_consultation06_patient_u16
yeah i tried paracetemol but uh didn't work to be honest i feel exactly the same|day4_consultation06_patient_u17
uh well uh the headache started like four year four hours ago so i would say like maybe three hours ago because i couldn't stand it|day4_consultation06_patient_u18
yeah yeah yeah i feel a little bit a little bit better i cannot stand screens|day4_consultation06_patient_u19
um but yeah definitely and when i move like the thing is that if i if i leave bed i start to feel like even worse if i move|day4_consultation06_patient_u20
so i just want to have my hay my head like really uh not moving|day4_consultation06_patient_u21
ohh yeah ohh i forgot to mention definitely i vomit twice|day4_consultation06_patient_u22
actually as soon as the the headache started i also vomited so initially i thought it was something that i ate but then the headache started to be really bad and i still feel nausea|day4_consultation06_patient_u23
to be honest i'm about to vomit very soon i think|day4_consultation06_patient_u24
sorry|day4_consultation06_patient_u25
yes|day4_consultation06_patient_u26
uh so uh uh not actually uh my mother has migraines i'm not sure if that's relevant|day4_consultation06_patient_u27
and uh also i have hypothyroidism in the family|day4_consultation06_patient_u28
so it might be i don't know uh i've i don't know|day4_consultation06_patient_u29
i think we are losing connection sorry i i think we lost connection|day4_consultation06_patient_u30

yeah not that i'm aware|day4_consultation06_patient_u37
uh i really doubt it|day4_consultation06_patient_u38
well i'm a little bit hypochondriac so i feel that this can be some kind of brain tumour tumour or something because i'm like this is really the pain is so horrible that or maybe a stroke i don't know it's it's just like you know you hear so many stories|day4_consultation06_patient_u39
that you definitely start wonder if i should go to a and e urgently because i might really have something serious|day4_consultation06_patient_u40
no no no no|day4_consultation06_patient_u41
uh not really|day4_consultation06_patient_u42
it's really about the head that's why i find it very weird|day4_consultation06_patient_u43

no|day4_consultation06_patient_u50
yeah|day4_consultation06_patient_u51
uh uh no it's the first time|day4_consultation06_patient_u52
but to be honest i'm very familiar with the disease because my mother has it so|day4_consultation06_patient_u53
uh well but i never had it and i thought that the onset of migraine will be you know in much uh early ages so that's why i'm not sure if migraine makes sense|day4_consultation06_patient_u54
mm hmm|day4_consultation06_patient_u55
ohh that's great|day4_consultation06_patient_u56
yeah|day4_consultation06_patient_u58

and so did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow|day2_consultation02_doctor_u7

sure ok uh and can i um can i just double check has anyone in your family got any kind of rheumatology diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or anything like that|day2_consultation02_doctor_u11
ok|day2_consultation02_doctor_u12
sure so you know you said you think you've got uh osteoarthritis has anyone ever told you that have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that and told you you've got osteoarthritis|day2_consultation02_doctor_u13
ok was that a gp or a specialist or was it a physiotherapist|day2_consultation02_doctor_u14
gp ok all right um look can i just uh sorry can i just double check how old you are please|day2_consultation02_doctor_u15
fifty three ok fantastic all right um and do you have any other illnesses at all|day2_consultation02_doctor_u16
right ok|day2_consultation02_doctor_u17
ok uh are you are are you allergic to any medication|day2_consultation02_doctor_u18
no|day2_consultation02_doctor_u19
sure and um do you um are you on any medication on a regular basis|day2_consultation02_doctor_u20
no ok and are you normally fit and well mobile and active|day2_consultation02_doctor_u21
ok good good glad to hear well done that's it's good that you're doing that on a regular basis ok um and um uh can i is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now|day2_consultation02_doctor_u22
ok good bear with me one second|day2_consultation02_doctor_u23
right ok and if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that a bit higher so i can just see the underside ok fantastic all right|day2_consultation02_doctor_u24
and then just bring it round to this side i can see other side ok fantastic all right and if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers|day2_consultation02_doctor_u25
there's is it is it hot compared to the surrounding skin the adjacent skin|day2_consultation02_doctor_u26
it's a bit warmer ok um and um is it very tender when you're pressing on that nerve is it if you if you give it a press does it hurt you at all|day2_consultation02_doctor_u27
ok all right um well um i noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the elbow do you do you have dry skin anywhere else on the body|day2_consultation02_doctor_u28
do you do you suffer from eczema at all|day2_consultation02_doctor_u29
no alright|day2_consultation02_doctor_u30
ok so um what i think we should do with regards to your elbow problem|day2_consultation02_doctor_u31
ok is um i think it would be worthwhile this seems like uh what we call the bursitis ok so that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint|day2_consultation02_doctor_u32
um what i think we should do is i think you should be on some anti inflammatory medication in the in the first instance|day2_consultation02_doctor_u33
and as well as that what i would like to do is to get some blood tests done to check for other types of uh causes of joint swelling k|day2_consultation02_doctor_u34
so um what we're going to do is we're going to arrange some um blood test forms to be sent out to your house and there'll be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done|day2_consultation02_doctor_u35
and that will involve you um having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers infection rheumatological antibodies|day2_consultation02_doctor_u36
so we'll do a full screen and also check for things like gout as well ok um|day2_consultation02_doctor_u37
the time frame for that will be um the results will come back to us after about five or six days um|day2_consultation02_doctor_u38
from now but it may take time for the form to come out to you and if you get the form get the blood tests done straight away by the time that we're expecting result back you know one or two days after that we're looking maybe six days|day2_consultation02_doctor_u39
and what i would suggest is we can arrange a follow up appointment for you in one of our clinics where we can have a look at your joint feel it we can review the blood test|day2_consultation02_doctor_u40
uh we can um get a gauge as to uh what's going on now in terms of your joint right now|day2_consultation02_doctor_u41
it doesn't look like to me that's something called excuse me septic arthritis so we're worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint|day2_consultation02_doctor_u42
um and uh your your joint doesn't look like that|day2_consultation02_doctor_u43
however if your the elbow was to become very red very painful uh and the redness was to spread or become uh you know more intense then you need to get on the phone or get have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible|day2_consultation02_doctor_u44
'cause that would be an emergency that would require more immediate assessment more immediate treatment ok|day2_consultation02_doctor_u45
no i i don't think this is anything dangerous don't need to worry ok what i'm doing is i'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to to develop k so this this is not the case right now right now it looks quite straightforward|day2_consultation02_doctor_u46
it's nothing sinister or life threatening um what i'm doing is i'm just saying in case things worsen these are the things that we'd be looking out for and this is what we have to do but you don't have that now thankfully and i don't think you're going to have it|day2_consultation02_doctor_u47
but i'm just saying the what if scenario is that ok|day2_consultation02_doctor_u48
all right did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me|day2_consultation02_doctor_u49
ok all right um|day2_consultation02_doctor_u50
ok so i i would take ibuprofen regularly ok you can get that over the counter um that's four hundred milligrams two times a day and you should take take that after food not on an empty stomach if you get any heartburn stop taking it ok|day2_consultation02_doctor_u51
all right so what i wanna do is i'll get the forms sent out to you|day2_consultation02_doctor_u52

ok so um at the moment just tell me about the exercise that you're doing normally|day5_consultation11_doctor_u7
and have you had any times when the knee feels like it's giving way underneath you|day5_consultation11_doctor_u10
so it means if you're if you're there and uh you just feel it sort of jolt like give way feel unstable underneath you|day5_consultation11_doctor_u11
and does it hurt uh how far into the run does it generally hurt|day5_consultation11_doctor_u12
ok ooh you're fast um|day5_consultation11_doctor_u13
um and um do you have to stop running or can you run through the pain|day5_consultation11_doctor_u14
ok|day5_consultation11_doctor_u15
ok|day5_consultation11_doctor_u16
right and you said before it's both knees|day5_consultation11_doctor_u17
and any problems with your left one|day5_consultation11_doctor_u19
ok and can you just describe in the knee or show me whereabouts the pain is happening mainly|day5_consultation11_doctor_u20
ok have you noticed any tenderness when you press over any areas in the knee|day5_consultation11_doctor_u21
ok does it look swollen to you|day5_consultation11_doctor_u22
does the knee look swollen|day5_consultation11_doctor_u23
ok and if you're sitting still for a while do you have any problems when you stand up any locking up of the knee|day5_consultation11_doctor_u25
can't straighten it any problems going up and down stairs|day5_consultation11_doctor_u26
any problems just walking normally|day5_consultation11_doctor_u27
and intervals of range of movement are you able to fully straighten the leg|day5_consultation11_doctor_u28
and what about fully flex it|day5_consultation11_doctor_u29
ok are you taking any medication for the knee|day5_consultation11_doctor_u30
ok and any other joint problems that you're getting any back pains small swelling of your hands feet elbows wrists any pain|day5_consultation11_doctor_u31
ok|day5_consultation11_doctor_u32
on your right side|day5_consultation11_doctor_u33
any change in colour or temperature of your lower legs|day5_consultation11_doctor_u34
any swelling which stays if you push in and then you release it that it stays there|day5_consultation11_doctor_u35
yeah any or any pain in the back of the calf or anything like that|day5_consultation11_doctor_u36
um and with your foot has that gone back to normal now do you feel any altered senstation tingling numbness anything like that|day5_consultation11_doctor_u37
okand any pain in the joints of your foot or on the underside in the arch any problems walking round on hard floors|day5_consultation11_doctor_u38
ok have you had any other medical problems before|day5_consultation11_doctor_u39
ok and do you take any other medications apart from the ones you told me about|day5_consultation11_doctor_u40
ok and any problems with your stomach or asthma indigestion acid reflux|day5_consultation11_doctor_u41
and what i would suggest is definitely carrying on with the ice therapy that you've been using so as much as you can 'cause that really does make a difference to injuries|day5_consultation11_doctor_u42
brings the healing blood into the area and it gives it the best chance of getting better so as much as you can use the ice|day5_consultation11_doctor_u43
um obviously you're trying to stick to a marathon programme but|day5_consultation11_doctor_u44
um i would try and ease up on the running if you can and if it if it's painful enough that you're having to stop running then it's not a good idea to do that|day5_consultation11_doctor_u45
um it's fine to take the ibuprofen um i can prescribe you a slightly stronger anti inflammatory that you can take regularly instead of the ibuprofen but not with the ibuprofen|day5_consultation11_doctor_u46
but make sure that with food ultimately we probably need to examine the knee|day5_consultation11_doctor_u47
um so the best thing i would suggest getting a appointment with the physiotherapist first who can do like a long assessment and examination of the knee|day5_consultation11_doctor_u48
and then we can make an assessment as to whether we need to do any um imagery to have a look inside the knee and see if there's any problem with the cartilage|day5_consultation11_doctor_u49
um it's it's not really possible to diagnose that over the over the video so we definitely would need to see you and the a physio is the best point of call because they'll probably be the most likely initial treatment|day5_consultation11_doctor_u50
but certainly if the appointment time's too long to wait then we can see we can see you in our clinic as well|day5_consultation11_doctor_u51
yep we can we can do a referral before that if in the meantime you develop like persistant swelling heat redness um of the knee or high temperature feel unwell or it completely locks up and you can't bend and stretch it|day5_consultation11_doctor_u52
then you'd need to see a doctor urgently so call us back in that case|day5_consultation11_doctor_u53
ok i'll send it through to your pharmacy for you ok thank you bye|day5_consultation11_doctor_u54

ok and have you ever been admitted in hospital because your was so bad|day3_consultation04_doctor_u18
ok|day3_consultation04_doctor_u19
righty ho when was the last time you had an asthma attack|day3_consultation04_doctor_u20
three to four years ago and what what did the gp do at that time|day3_consultation04_doctor_u21
ok so you didn't have any oral steroids or antibiotics|day3_consultation04_doctor_u22
ok um ok right have you ever had oral steroids in the past|day3_consultation04_doctor_u23
when was the last time you had an asthma review with our nurse|day3_consultation04_doctor_u24
ok two years ago|day3_consultation04_doctor_u25
ok but your asthma was pretty under control till till now isn't it|day3_consultation04_doctor_u26
yes so do you do a peak flow meter at home peak flow reading where you blow into you know|day3_consultation04_doctor_u27
do you do that no|day3_consultation04_doctor_u28
ok so what was what's your peak flow reading when you're good|day3_consultation04_doctor_u29
like normally peak flow reading|day3_consultation04_doctor_u30
ok let's see it's about um three eighty yeah yeah three ok|day3_consultation04_doctor_u31
right so that's your normal yeah righty ho ok so what we need|day3_consultation04_doctor_u32
ok do you have any allergies at all|day3_consultation04_doctor_u33

ok so you're not allergic to anything ok|day3_consultation04_doctor_u36
so no allergies ok excellent righty ho|day3_consultation04_doctor_u37
so what we need to do that obviously we you haven't had an asthma check for sometime and it looks like you can be having a small small exacerbation|day3_consultation04_doctor_u38
so what i would like you to be seen by one of our gp's in the next few days|day3_consultation04_doctor_u39
in the interim what i'd like you to do is you can use your blue inhaler as and when|day3_consultation04_doctor_u40
ok you can use it maximum about every two to four four hours but if you're using it that often that means pretty much that you know your asthma is really bad you can use it but that's not ideal|day3_consultation04_doctor_u41
but uh the brown your clenil the brown inhaler|day3_consultation04_doctor_u42
you can up the dose if you're using just three puffs twice a day you can increase it to four puffs twice a day|day3_consultation04_doctor_u43
yeah and while this is to do while you're waiting to see us|day3_consultation04_doctor_u44
now i've mentioned you know you're doing you know increase the uh clenil to four puffs twice a day and you're using the asthma you know the blue inhalers every two to four hours|day3_consultation04_doctor_u45
and your breathing is getting really worse then you would need to take yourself to a and e you shouldn't wait for our appointment|day3_consultation04_doctor_u46
ok so when you'd opt to sneeze you what we're going to do is we're gonna examine your chest yeah|day3_consultation04_doctor_u47
make you do the peak flow reading so depending on what we find you might need some antibiotics and some steroids|day3_consultation04_doctor_u48
but anyway while you're at home we're going to by increasing your clenil we are increasing your steroid intake anyway|day3_consultation04_doctor_u49
so yeah so any questions you wanted to ask me|day3_consultation04_doctor_u50
yeah so book an call support book an appointment to see and i will recommend that meet her face to face|day3_consultation04_doctor_u51
in the interim increase your brown inhaler to four puffs twice a day and your salbutamol inhalers up to every two hourly but if you breathing's getting worse and you've not seen us do take your puffs to a and e|day3_consultation04_doctor_u52
all right|day3_consultation04_doctor_u53

hi|day5_consultation11_patient_u0
hi doctor smith|day5_consultation11_patient_u1
yes my name is mary jo date of birth is january first nineteen eighty|day5_consultation11_patient_u2
and my address is uh sixty sloane avenue london|day5_consultation11_patient_u3
absolutely|day5_consultation11_patient_u4
so a couple of things i i think i may have overdone my workouts and now my knees are hurting and they're clicking a lot and it's starting to worry me|day5_consultation11_patient_u5
um i can't run very far um any more without just feeling pain in my knees|day5_consultation11_patient_u6
and then sometimes i also get this weird tingling in my toes um|day5_consultation11_patient_u7
so yeah that's that's it i'm just concerned and i figured you know i'd call and see if you can help me figure out what's going on|day5_consultation11_patient_u8
so probably it's been about two weeks|day5_consultation11_patient_u9
you know not not really i mean i play a lot of sports um and i had a like i play some ice hockey and i had this injury a few months ago|day5_consultation11_patient_u10
you know i just like fell on the ice and and you know had a huge bruise but i think that's about it|day5_consultation11_patient_u11
so i'm training well i'm currently training for a marathon um that's gonna happen in june and so i'm trying to run like|day5_consultation11_patient_u12
i mean right now i'm actually not even doing such long runs maybe like seven or eight miles and so i started about uh maybe a month ago|day5_consultation11_patient_u13
uh i've done like you know four or five miles and i've just done like a couple of seven mile runs|day5_consultation11_patient_u14
and then uh uh and then you know i go to the gym like few times a week and kinda do my usual routine|day5_consultation11_patient_u15
um but yeah i think the only thing that's really different has have been the runs the longer runs|day5_consultation11_patient_u16
um well i what do you mean by that i'm not sure what what that means|day5_consultation11_patient_u17
not not bad i mean it just kinda starts hurting you know um|day5_consultation11_patient_u18
you know i would say probably starts off like after uh maybe twenty minutes or so which is probably i don't know like somewhere around mile three maybe two and a half or three miles|day5_consultation11_patient_u19
switching my kilometres and miles i'm not sure all right|day5_consultation11_patient_u20
yeah that is a good question so um you know the last few times the last time i actually stopped i mean i ran a little bit longer but then i stopped because it was um i i feel like it's getting worse|day5_consultation11_patient_u21
um and when i start doing my abs that's you know when i do my abs it's kind of requiring me to move my you know um to kind of go from the flex position on my knees and straighten my legs then i feel all this clicking|day5_consultation11_patient_u22
and i think that's also freaked me out and uh i just figured you know something's wrong here|day5_consultation11_patient_u23
so it's more um it's actually my right knee that hurts|day5_consultation11_patient_u24
no|day5_consultation11_patient_u25
so ah you know i i feel it it's kind of weird i feel it in the middle but i almost feel like maybe it kind of uh um moves to the right to the right of my knee a little bit|day5_consultation11_patient_u26
so yes well it's i have probably some fluid i googled it and you know it says that sometimes fluid accumulates uh i|day5_consultation11_patient_u27
sorry|day5_consultation11_patient_u28
um well it did like the first time i ran it was a little bit swollen but then i just put some like ice on it and it went away|day5_consultation11_patient_u29
um but right now right now it's not swollen and right now it doesn't hurt you know|day5_consultation11_patient_u30
um but it just kind of comes on when uh um or you know right now when i flex and extend my leg it there's no clicking but i'll notice it in the gym and then you know when i run it'll start hurting|day5_consultation11_patient_u31
no|day5_consultation11_patient_u32
no|day5_consultation11_patient_u33
no none i don't|day5_consultation11_patient_u34
yes|day5_consultation11_patient_u35
yes|day5_consultation11_patient_u36
well um since you're asking um yes i i take ibuprofen um and i'll just kinda use it sometime like uh um like sometimes i have some joint issues but you know that kind of is not very frequent so i'll take ibuprofen for that|day5_consultation11_patient_u37
but you know it's nothing like major maybe like four hundred milligrams max something like that|day5_consultation11_patient_u38
i also sometimes will um you know smoke a joint|day5_consultation11_patient_u39
um and yeah other than that that's it|day5_consultation11_patient_u40
no|day5_consultation11_patient_u41
uh well i have sometimes you know how sometimes like if you stand for a long time your feet will kinda or your legs will swell up like i noticed it because of my socks i'll just kind of notice this indentation|day5_consultation11_patient_u42
and then another weird thing i've felt this just once but there was this tingling in my toes like uh um after the run|day5_consultation11_patient_u43
there was tingling in my toes like on my you know my right toes um so|day5_consultation11_patient_u44
yes|day5_consultation11_patient_u45
no|day5_consultation11_patient_u46
well i don't know if i really try that but i i will tell you that what i noticed is like if i you know when my socks come off i kind of notice that indentation a little bit i mean it's not like major right but i uh i mean do you mean i just need to like press and see what happens if it like kind of stays or|day5_consultation11_patient_u47

uh no|day4_consultation09_patient_u16
yeah yeah i have asthma i've had it for a while now um|day4_consultation09_patient_u17
and then i have like a hayfever you know and some allergies just to dust stuff like that|day4_consultation09_patient_u18
um yeah so uh you know the um uh ventolin it's called uh salbutamol|day4_consultation09_patient_u19

and i had a milk protein allergy when i was young too|day4_consultation09_patient_u28
um|day4_consultation09_patient_u29
not really like i feel like asthma's probably a part of it and probably getting my inhalers would be helpful|day4_consultation09_patient_u30
um it's just kinda scary 'cause i haven't had a time like this where i've been so tight uh in a long time|day4_consultation09_patient_u31
i mean it gets a little bit worse at night but basically just pretty consistent and it hasn't gone away|day4_consultation09_patient_u32
no not really pain it's more like tight|day4_consultation09_patient_u33
it just feels like sometimes i can't get a full breath in you know|day4_consultation09_patient_u34
not in a long time when i was young a little bit more like back in high school um but i've been pretty good at taking my my inhalers so not not so much any more|day4_consultation09_patient_u35

all righty well thank you very much|day4_consultation09_patient_u58
all right sounds good|day4_consultation09_patient_u59
ok thank you bye bye|day4_consultation09_patient_u60
hi|day4_consultation03_doctor_u0
hi can you hear me|day4_consultation03_doctor_u1
good um my name is doctor gohil i'm one of the physicians that works here at babylon|day4_consultation03_doctor_u2
may i confirm your name and date of birth please|day4_consultation03_doctor_u3
nineteen eighty three and are you in a space that's private and quiet and you can talk|day4_consultation03_doctor_u5
good so it says erm i've got a note to say it says you're feeling short of breath is that correct|day4_consultation03_doctor_u6
ok are you able to tell me a little bit more about that|day4_consultation03_doctor_u7
that is while you're sitting watching tv|day4_consultation03_doctor_u8
ok and have you noticed anything like this before|day4_consultation03_doctor_u9
ok and apart from the shortness of breath have you noticed anything else|day4_consultation03_doctor_u10
ok|day4_consultation03_doctor_u11
ok and how long ago was that just a few weeks|day4_consultation03_doctor_u12
ok and are you with baby at the moment|day4_consultation03_doctor_u13
and how is baby doing|day4_consultation03_doctor_u14
ok any coughs or colds with uh them|day4_consultation03_doctor_u15
ok so you've noticed shortness of breath for just an hour while sitting and watching tv|day4_consultation03_doctor_u16
and you had your c section a couple of weeks ago|day4_consultation03_doctor_u17
and yesterday you noticed a cough|day4_consultation03_doctor_u18
so talk to me about the cough have you bought anything up|day4_consultation03_doctor_u19
and when was the last time you were ill with the flu or symptoms like this|day4_consultation03_doctor_u20
ok and this shortness of breath you're having is it getting worse|day4_consultation03_doctor_u21
ok so you're feeling your heart more than normal|day4_consultation03_doctor_u22
and the shortness of breath does it cause any pain in your chest|day4_consultation03_doctor_u23
how about when you take a very deep breath in|day4_consultation03_doctor_u24
ok|day4_consultation03_doctor_u25
and since your c section did you have to take any medications|day4_consultation03_doctor_u26
all right and can you remember what the name of those were|day4_consultation03_doctor_u27
and have you had to use that regularly|day4_consultation03_doctor_u28
ok and apart from the c section and the shortness of breath have you got any other medical problems i should know about|day4_consultation03_doctor_u29
and you were|day4_consultation03_doctor_u30
ok|day4_consultation03_doctor_u31
and what happens when you take ibuprofen|day4_consultation03_doctor_u32
so i need you to do something for me have you measured the rate of your heart before|day4_consultation03_doctor_u34
have you measured it recently either with an iwatch or something similar|day4_consultation03_doctor_u35
ok we might need to do that over the phone so are you able to put your right hand on your left wrist just underneath your thumb and see if you can feel your heartbeat|day4_consultation03_doctor_u36
so uh what i need you to do is when i count to three count down from three just count the number of beats you've noticed and i'll tell you when to stop is that ok|day4_consultation03_doctor_u37
so we'll start in three two one go|day4_consultation03_doctor_u38
great that should be enough how many did you count|day4_consultation03_doctor_u39
good|day4_consultation03_doctor_u40
so your heart is running slightly fast at the moment which is probably because of the shortness of breath and some of the pain that you're under|day4_consultation03_doctor_u41
given that you've had a c section and you're short of breath which has come on quite recently and quite quickly|day4_consultation03_doctor_u42
it might be worth you going into the hospital to get checked out the bit further|day4_consultation03_doctor_u43
so there's two ways of us doing this the first is i can call an ambulance or you can take yourself to the hospital with baby|day4_consultation03_doctor_u44
which one would you prefer|day4_consultation03_doctor_u45
sure and what i would suggest is go fairly quickly and take some bits for baby at the same time|day4_consultation03_doctor_u46
and if you're taking any medications like codeine don't don't take them for the time being|day4_consultation03_doctor_u47
is anyone else with you at home|day4_consultation03_doctor_u48
ok|day4_consultation03_doctor_u49
so i think that's the best thing to do for the time being|day4_consultation03_doctor_u50
so what i'm worried about at the moment is given that you've had a c section|day4_consultation03_doctor_u51
some people can suffer with clots and those can either be found in the legs or your chest so in your lungs|day4_consultation03_doctor_u52
it's quite a common thing to happen and it's not something to worry about but needs to be checked out in the hospital first|day4_consultation03_doctor_u53
and if it if that does become the case they can give you something to reduce the clot|day4_consultation03_doctor_u54
fairly quick process|day4_consultation03_doctor_u55
good are you uh are you particularly worried about anything or do you want to ask me anything before we go|day4_consultation03_doctor_u56
great thank you so much|day4_consultation03_doctor_u57
hi there i'm doctor smith from babylon|day5_consultation03_doctor_u0

ok are you in a private place where you can have a confidential consultation today|day5_consultation03_doctor_u3
what can i do for you|day5_consultation03_doctor_u4
ok do you mind just telling me a bit more about when it started do you think there's something which changed in your life at that time|day5_consultation03_doctor_u5
what's your job|day5_consultation03_doctor_u6
ok so um just day to day tell me from the start of your day how it affects you you said that you you dread going to work|day5_consultation03_doctor_u7
how how does it affect you in terms of like your sleep at night and things like that|day5_consultation03_doctor_u8
ok so what time what time do you go to bed at night time|day5_consultation03_doctor_u9
and what time do you get to sleep|day5_consultation03_doctor_u10
ok and when you eventually get to sleep do you wake up with your alarm in the morning or does something else wake you up before then|day5_consultation03_doctor_u11
ok and so how many hours sleep do you think you get a night|day5_consultation03_doctor_u12
ok and what about your eating patterns any change in how you're eating or whether you your appetite's changed|day5_consultation03_doctor_u13
ok you're eating regularly otherwise|day5_consultation03_doctor_u14
ok and you told me about the palpitations just tell me a bit more about that|day5_consultation03_doctor_u15
does it feel like a regular fast beat or an irregular beat|day5_consultation03_doctor_u17
and how long do you think it lasts for when you get it|day5_consultation03_doctor_u18
ok is that something that you've had before this or is that a new thing|day5_consultation03_doctor_u19
ok any chest pain with that|day5_consultation03_doctor_u20
ok|day5_consultation03_doctor_u21
and in the daytime how how you said you you're not getting much sleep so how's your energy level in the daytime|day5_consultation03_doctor_u22
ok so what do you do in the evenings|day5_consultation03_doctor_u23
ok and are you avoiding contact with friends or do you still see them|day5_consultation03_doctor_u24
ok what about hobbies or exercise or anything else outside work do you do anything else outside work|day5_consultation03_doctor_u25
and have you has it ever got so bad that you've actually had to miss work|day5_consultation03_doctor_u26
ok|day5_consultation03_doctor_u27
and what's the worst that it's got have you ever been um so overwhelmed that you couldn't get in to the office you couldn't go into a situation|day5_consultation03_doctor_u28
have you ever had a panic attack|day5_consultation03_doctor_u29
ok and apart from work are there any other situations which evoke quite extreme anxiety like being in public places social situations public transport anything like that|day5_consultation03_doctor_u30
ok before this did you have any similar times in your life when you felt like this|day5_consultation03_doctor_u31
ok and what about your mood day to day i mean i can see that you're quite distressed by like that do you ever get really down about this|day5_consultation03_doctor_u32
when do you think you last felt yourself|day5_consultation03_doctor_u33
and has your mood ever been so low that you've felt like you just couldn't carry on with your job or with your life or with your normal uh things as they we're going on|day5_consultation03_doctor_u34
yeah ok and where do you who do you live with at home|day5_consultation03_doctor_u35
who do you live with at home|day5_consultation03_doctor_u36
um and how much alcohol do you have in an average week do you think|day5_consultation03_doctor_u37
ok so how much would you would you guess|day5_consultation03_doctor_u38
ok do you smoke or take any other drugs or anything|day5_consultation03_doctor_u39
ok and have you done anything yourself to help have you have you talked to anyone talked to any counsellors done any online looked online at all any ways to|day5_consultation03_doctor_u40
ok|day5_consultation03_doctor_u41
ok|day5_consultation03_doctor_u42
and would you be happy to have some one to one therapy|day5_consultation03_doctor_u43
ok i mean what we would suggest in the first instance is to to so you can self refer via the nhs for what we call like talking therapy which is a type of inter behavioural where they can really look at your situation how you're reacting to the why what's provoking anxiety and what you can do to try and overcome that|day5_consultation03_doctor_u44
um so i can send you the link for that|day5_consultation03_doctor_u45
um in the meantimes it can be a bit of a wait there are some online resources that are really helpful um can put the details on there and you can get on with them straight away and try and work through them as well|day5_consultation03_doctor_u46
um and if you're feeling like it's not helping at all or your anxiety is getting worse to the point where you can't cope with work or you can't just do your normal things day to day then it's important for us to for you to give us a call back and just discuss that further|day5_consultation03_doctor_u47
i mean some people with anxiety they do need to take medication to control that but that's not something that we'd suggest in the first instance|day5_consultation03_doctor_u48
and i'll put some more information on your notes about helping with your sleep patterns and things like that|day5_consultation03_doctor_u49
um in terms of palpitations it is most likely to be a associated with anxiety but it's probably worth having couple of basic blood tests just to make sure that there's not something triggering that off and then arranging a gp follow up a week after you've had the tests so we can just go through the results with you|day5_consultation03_doctor_u50
so if you call the support line you can arrange the to have the blood test done|day5_consultation03_doctor_u51
ok|day5_consultation03_doctor_u52
all right take care|day5_consultation03_doctor_u53
sorry|day5_consultation03_doctor_u54
hi there|day1_consultation13_patient_u0
yes it's um adriana katherine and i'm twenty six year old|day1_consultation13_patient_u1
well i have this like really crazy headache that's been going on for a few days and it really annoys me|day1_consultation13_patient_u2
eh around three days ago maybe|day1_consultation13_patient_u3
um it's basically like it kind of feels all over my head but like mainly um around my right eye um|day1_consultation13_patient_u4
um it's it kind of comes and goes um but i mean it is there all the time but like sometimes it's stronger|day1_consultation13_patient_u5
ohh it's probably a eight|day1_consultation13_patient_u6
um it's kind of it's dull but sometimes it gets a bit sharper so basically it like it developed gradually i guess it's like the first day it just started when i was at work|day1_consultation13_patient_u7
and by the end of the day it was like pretty pretty like it was a lot basically and then i was thinking ok maybe i'll just go to sleep and when i woke up the next morning like it was even even worse basically so|day1_consultation13_patient_u8
yeah|day1_consultation13_patient_u9
um so i tried uh ibuprofen um so i took like a few um for the last two days basically|day1_consultation13_patient_u10
but it doesn't really help no in in the past it did help me which is why i decided to try it but|day1_consultation13_patient_u11
um|day1_consultation13_patient_u12
not really but just when it started i i got this like weird shooting lights and like now like light is quite annoying my eyes|day1_consultation13_patient_u13
yeah yeah it hurts so|day1_consultation13_patient_u14
not loss of vision i wouldn't say it's just like some lights from shooting lights|day1_consultation13_patient_u15
um well i'm like basically i i'm sick with the headache but i no vomiting|day1_consultation13_patient_u16
yeah|day1_consultation13_patient_u17
no|day1_consultation13_patient_u18
no|day1_consultation13_patient_u19
no it's hard to focus though so i i had to take a couple of days off work actually|day1_consultation13_patient_u20
uh no|day1_consultation13_patient_u21
yeah i mean headaches you mean|day1_consultation13_patient_u22
yeah i mean i had but usually after i i take uh ibuprofen it kind of goes away so but this time it's just not|day1_consultation13_patient_u23
no|day1_consultation13_patient_u24
mm no not that i've noticed|day1_consultation13_patient_u25
am i what sorry|day1_consultation13_patient_u26
yeah i think so it's just the headache|day1_consultation13_patient_u27
not myself i've never had a migraine but my sister and my mom have them quite frequently|day1_consultation13_patient_u28
uh no no|day1_consultation13_patient_u29
mm not that i know of|day1_consultation13_patient_u30
yeah|day1_consultation13_patient_u31
um so my sister's like better like it's kind of it's very rare but my mom's is like quite bad um usually when there's like a season changing and stuff like that it's yeah|day1_consultation13_patient_u32
takes her out for a few days basically|day1_consultation13_patient_u33
uh i live with housemates so three of them so we're four|day1_consultation13_patient_u34
yeah so i work well i work in it so i work with computers a lot so it kind of is difficult to focus um i had to like reduce the uh brightness of my screen|day1_consultation13_patient_u35
yes i do|day1_consultation13_patient_u36
no uh i've been wearing them since i was five five year old so it's quite a long time|day1_consultation13_patient_u37
well it's been a bit stressful kicking off a new project but um yeah nothing out of the ordinary really|day1_consultation13_patient_u39
i socially smoke and i drink only socially|day1_consultation13_patient_u40
um|day1_consultation13_patient_u41
not really um at first i thought it's stress or maybe i didn't drink enough water because sometimes when i don't drink enough water i i like get headaches um|day1_consultation13_patient_u42
but i don't think that's it and i'm like worried it's i don't want it to be a migraine because i know what it's like from my mom and my sister|day1_consultation13_patient_u43
and it's really annoying so i i really don't want to have that and i know it's genetic so i've researched that um but i don't know if that is the case so yeah|day1_consultation13_patient_u44
yeah maybe just kinda if you have any recommendations of that i can take something stronger because apparently ibuprofen doesn't help me uh|day1_consultation13_patient_u45
usually it gets resolved if i have headache in like after like one or two days but currently it it didn't help me|day1_consultation13_patient_u46
uh three a day|day1_consultation13_patient_u47
ohh right|day1_consultation13_patient_u49
mm hmm|day1_consultation13_patient_u50

no|day5_consultation09_doctor_u44
ok and who do you live with at home|day5_consultation09_doctor_u45
um|day5_consultation09_doctor_u46
sorry um so with this rash we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms and just because of your symptoms which have been ongoing for six weeks that's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels|day5_consultation09_doctor_u47
um i think it's important to get some blood tests checking all the normal things like liver kidneys blood count etc but also some more specific things like um a bacterial infection you can sometimes get uh including one which you can get which can produce a rash like that so that would involve blood tests are you happy to do that|day5_consultation09_doctor_u48
well you can get uh you can get a bacterial infection caused which is called um it's called lyme disease that you can get a rash like that from a tick bite|day5_consultation09_doctor_u49
so that's something we would do a test for as well um and if that comes back positive then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it|day5_consultation09_doctor_u50
so it's definitely worth checking for but we would also check just for which can cause reduced energy tiredness and aching for persistent over six weeks|day5_consultation09_doctor_u51
so if you're happy to do that if you book that through the support line and then when you've had the test arrange a follow up about a week after after you've had the test done|day5_consultation09_doctor_u52
um yeah we can do that over the phone to start with|day5_consultation09_doctor_u53
ok|day5_consultation09_doctor_u54
any other questions|day5_consultation09_doctor_u56
ok that's great take care|day5_consultation09_doctor_u57
sorry|day5_consultation09_doctor_u58

ok um so this headache is new to you and you've you've not had regular headaches before|day5_consultation01_doctor_u45
what i would suggest is taking uh um some anti inflammatories along with the paracetamol|day5_consultation01_doctor_u46
um as a uh you said you're eating ok|day5_consultation01_doctor_u47
i mean it from the sounds of it it does sound quite like a migraine but obviously if you had no history of that in the past|day5_consultation01_doctor_u48
um and is anything changed recently or any anything you've done recently might've triggered it|day5_consultation01_doctor_u49
yeah um well that would be the first thing to do is to take some anti inflammatories along with the paracetamol make sure you're really well hydrated|day5_consultation01_doctor_u51
um and see how that goes and if it if it isn't settling or it's getting worse or you get any other change in your headache um or you're unwell with it with a high temperature then we would certainly need to speak to you|day5_consultation01_doctor_u52
straight away about that the other thing is if you if you're getting persistent um headaches or headaches associated with your menstrual cycle or certain things seem to trigger these headaches|day5_consultation01_doctor_u53
then it it would be worth having a further discussion about it to see whether we can work out if we can help the that longer term|day5_consultation01_doctor_u54
um i would try and arrange to get your blood pressure checked if you haven't had it checked for a while|day5_consultation01_doctor_u55
uh and thing to do is to have a thermometer at home so you can make sure that your temperature's ok|day5_consultation01_doctor_u56

ok ok then we'll we'll we'll um speak to you again|day5_consultation01_doctor_u59
very much bye|day5_consultation01_doctor_u60
hello hi i'm doctor jacob and welcome to babylon|day3_consultation02_doctor_u0
hi so just before we start is it alright if you could confirm your name for me please|day3_consultation02_doctor_u1
ok and your date of birth|day3_consultation02_doctor_u2
and your address for me please|day3_consultation02_doctor_u3
that's correct and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation|day3_consultation02_doctor_u5
ok so i understand you're having a a headache is that correct|day3_consultation02_doctor_u6
ok right and um so what started first was it the headache or the fever|day3_consultation02_doctor_u8
ok afterwards right and what have you taken so far for your headache|day3_consultation02_doctor_u9
ok so just a few more questions with regards to your headache so do you find it difficult to look at the light|day3_consultation02_doctor_u10
ok uh and is it any pain when you try to move your neck from side to side look up and down is there any pain|day3_consultation02_doctor_u11
ok all over right and have you been sick with this headache|day3_consultation02_doctor_u12
ok and do you have a cough|day3_consultation02_doctor_u13
ok so there's no cough or cold yeah|day3_consultation02_doctor_u14
ok and you your ears are ok there's no earaches|day3_consultation02_doctor_u15
ok all right and with this headache have you experienced any pins and needles in your face arms and legs|day3_consultation02_doctor_u16
no pins and needles any muscle weaknesses at all|day3_consultation02_doctor_u17
not not any weakness but where you couldn't you know hold a cup or anything like that that's what i mean|day3_consultation02_doctor_u18
ohh|day3_consultation02_doctor_u19
okay and um just a few more questions to you because i don't have any of your background history um do you suffer from any medical conditions|day3_consultation02_doctor_u20
fine and no surgical history then and no medical surgical complaints yeah|day3_consultation02_doctor_u21
right and um do you have any kind of shivering at all do you shivering with the fever|day3_consultation02_doctor_u23
cold yeah ok right and are you using you mentioned about the paracetamol and now but are you on any regular any medication anything that you're using at all|day3_consultation02_doctor_u24
ok um any allergies at all|day3_consultation02_doctor_u25
alright|day3_consultation02_doctor_u26
ok and ok so uh i i believe that it is quite important for us to actually examine you yeah|day3_consultation02_doctor_u27
um it it's not possible for us to do that online i think you would need to come into one of our hubs to have a proper examination and i i think you would need one quite urgently ok so the thing that's running in the back of my mind are um kind of a viral illnesses that can one can get with um sort of mosquito bites or foreign travel|day3_consultation02_doctor_u28
like um the other common thing around thailand it will be like some dengue but that would have like you would have some uh blood spots or bleeding or something which you don't have at the moment do you|day3_consultation02_doctor_u29
ok so where is the rash|day3_consultation02_doctor_u30
how would you describe how would you describe the rash|day3_consultation02_doctor_u31
red and itchy ok so if you were to put a glass on top of the rash does that rash go away|day3_consultation02_doctor_u32
it goes away ok|day3_consultation02_doctor_u33
ok so what we need to do need to urgently examine you and that's sometime today ok and um after our examination there is a high possibility that sometimes we might need to send you to hospital but i'm not sure as yet so i'd like you to be seen in one of our hubs as soon as possible|day3_consultation02_doctor_u34
so um i'll recommend that you would need to be urgently seen by the doctor preferably in the next few hours time ok and um in any case if that's not available i'd like you to take yourself to alright any questions at all|day3_consultation02_doctor_u35
you know obviously when i've spoken to you you you didn't tick the box for many theories but you're in the middle somewhere let's put it that way|day3_consultation02_doctor_u36
um you know things like we have to rule out is meningitis and all but ben you just have a general muscle ache you didn't say that you had things like you had problems looking at the light or something those are things when you think of meningitis|day3_consultation02_doctor_u37
but and then it's the uh in meningitis you get a non blanching rash while in any kind of virus the rash usually goes away saying that we don't know whether these are the beginning stage so that's why i'd rather but i would rather you see a gp as soon as possible if uh we've got a slot available but if not i think you need to be seen and maybe have some blood tests and examinations ok|day3_consultation02_doctor_u38
all right you take care ben bye now cheers bye|day3_consultation02_doctor_u39
yeah|day1_consultation04_patient_u1
alright so i've been feeling i've been feeling kind of uh under the weather for the past four days|day1_consultation04_patient_u2
um it started with the um uh sore throat and runny nose and|day1_consultation04_patient_u3
it's sort of um it's sort of going into a cough now um the sort throat is kind of going away but um i'm starting to cough|day1_consultation04_patient_u4
and uh kind of uh bad and tired|day1_consultation04_patient_u5
um so i i you know i think i it all started with uh this colleague of mine she just kept sneezing next to me all the time i think her kids are catching something from the|day1_consultation04_patient_u6
uh from their kindergarten or something and uh you know the it it started as normal sore throat and uh was quite painful for a couple days but then it was past|day1_consultation04_patient_u7

um i i had some some fever in the beginning but it's now sort of uh going down i i've been taking some paracetamol and ibuprofen for that and uh they they help|day1_consultation04_patient_u21
um so no pain in chest but uh i noticed that i um um so i feel a bit winded on exertion so if i i i haven't been going going to the gym thus uh because of that|day1_consultation04_patient_u22
yeah|day1_consultation04_patient_u23
yeah yeah when when when i'm resting it's ok so i've been actually going to work um sort of managing|day1_consultation04_patient_u24

um yeah yeah that that's still that's still there|day1_consultation04_patient_u28
um it's sort of general uh and uh they're not they're not always there but you know every now and then they will come and go|day1_consultation04_patient_u29
um no|day1_consultation04_patient_u30
no i don't think so|day1_consultation04_patient_u31
no none of that|day1_consultation04_patient_u32
uh yeah yeah think so|day1_consultation04_patient_u33
yeah yeah|day1_consultation04_patient_u34

um no no|day1_consultation04_patient_u37
yeah yeah yeah that's that sort of started in the past couple days|day1_consultation04_patient_u38

ok and when did you last have your blood pressure checked|day5_consultation07_doctor_u32
do you know if it do you know if it's been stable|day5_consultation07_doctor_u33
ok and with your blood with your diabetes have you had a blood test recently|day5_consultation07_doctor_u34
ok and do you know what dose of the lisinopril you're taking|day5_consultation07_doctor_u35
ok have you been able to pass water normally any increase in in frequency that you're passing water or any increased thirst|day5_consultation07_doctor_u36
and has your weight been stable|day5_consultation07_doctor_u37
what is your weight and height|day5_consultation07_doctor_u38
ok and do you smoke at all|day5_consultation07_doctor_u39

okum who do you live with at home|day5_consultation07_doctor_u41
and do you work|day5_consultation07_doctor_u42
ok|day5_consultation07_doctor_u43
and have you been doing anything yourself to help with the symptoms anything that you've bought in the chemist|day5_consultation07_doctor_u44
do you what what do you mean by quite a few how many in in a day do you normally take|day5_consultation07_doctor_u46
ok have you noticed any improvement in that|day5_consultation07_doctor_u47
ok um do you have any allergies to anything|day5_consultation07_doctor_u48
any any allergies to any medications at all|day5_consultation07_doctor_u49
ok so what you've described to me it sounds like you you probably have got an infection in the chest um because it's it you know you're obviously getting symptoms of from your nose and your chest um it sounds like you might have a high temperature it's definitely worth getting a thermometer and checking your temperature|day5_consultation07_doctor_u50
yeah and most of the time these infections are caused by viruses so they do normally settle by themselves but it can take you know a week or two um and you can persistently have the cough ongoing longer than that|day5_consultation07_doctor_u51
um the important thing to do would be to take your temperature|day5_consultation07_doctor_u52
um and if you feel like if the temperature's ongoing above thirty seven point five thirty eight um and you keep spiking temperatures and that's not settling down or your cough's getting worse you're coughing up lots of nasty phlegm or you cough up any blood or get blood coming out your nose|day5_consultation07_doctor_u53
um or any shortness of breath chest pain then we certainly would need to speak to you again with the diabetes you are a bit more likely to get a bacterial infection than if you didn't have the diabetes so it's something we do need to be careful of|day5_consultation07_doctor_u54
yeah potentially if it is if it's not settling or the temperature's ongoing getting worse then we definitely need to talk to you again|day5_consultation07_doctor_u55
um have you got any other questions|day5_consultation07_doctor_u56
it's fine to carry on what you're doing at the moment with the lemsip i wouldn't take and that that contains paracetamol so don't take any other paracetamol containing products um with that at the same time|day5_consultation07_doctor_u57
um the cough syrup isn't advisable in the daytime because it's best for your body if you just keep coughing but if you're kept up all night and you can't sleep at all then it it's ok to have a little bit of cough syrup just to settle that down|day5_consultation07_doctor_u58
ok do you have blood sugar checking equipment do you check no ok well if you make sure that you have the regular diabetes and blood pressure checkups that your gp has asked you for|day5_consultation07_doctor_u59
ok great alright then take care bye|day5_consultation07_doctor_u60

ok um and um can i just double check does anyone in your family have any migraines or anything like that they've been diagnosed with migraines|day2_consultation10_doctor_u15
ok um and um are you under any particular stress at the moment|day2_consultation10_doctor_u16
right ok um and um how long has that been the case for|day2_consultation10_doctor_u17
how would you say your mood is|day2_consultation10_doctor_u18
ok do you have have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety or depression or stress in the past|day2_consultation10_doctor_u19
ok are you taking sertraline at the moment|day2_consultation10_doctor_u20
ok um and how do you feel in terms of anxiety at the moment do you feel anxious at the moment|day2_consultation10_doctor_u21
ok all right um now sorry to ask this just need to ask this for anyone suffering from anxiety do you have any have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or hurting yourself|day2_consultation10_doctor_u23
good i'm glad to hear that um now with regards to this headache is it worse when you lie down or um is is is it better when you lie down|day2_consultation10_doctor_u24
ok|day2_consultation10_doctor_u25
um so would you say ultimately it's better when you lie down or have you not|day2_consultation10_doctor_u26
ok um and um in terms of um this headache since this morning have you taken anything for it yet|day2_consultation10_doctor_u27
has that helped|day2_consultation10_doctor_u28
ok taking anything else at all|day2_consultation10_doctor_u29
ok um do you have any other illnesses at all|day2_consultation10_doctor_u30
have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure|day2_consultation10_doctor_u31
have you ever had your blood pressure checked|day2_consultation10_doctor_u32
ok um and are there any illnesses in your family|day2_consultation10_doctor_u33
ok all right and um are you on any medication|day2_consultation10_doctor_u34
do you have any allergies to any medication|day2_consultation10_doctor_u35
all right and are you living by yourself at the moment or living with someone else|day2_consultation10_doctor_u36
ok are you a smoker|day2_consultation10_doctor_u37
ok and uh do you have any pets at home|day2_consultation10_doctor_u38
ok and can i just double check how much exercise would you do normally a week|day2_consultation10_doctor_u39
ok|day2_consultation10_doctor_u40
and what's your diet like|day2_consultation10_doctor_u41
ok|day2_consultation10_doctor_u42
all right um now um in terms of this headache uh obviously i haven't been able to examine you or see you directly|day2_consultation10_doctor_u43
but um it sounds like it might be one of two things it could be an element of what we call tension headache|day2_consultation10_doctor_u44
ok that's one possibility um and what makes that more likely is the fact that you've been under some pressure and you have a history of anxiety in the past ok um|day2_consultation10_doctor_u45
the other possibility is um migraine as well|day2_consultation10_doctor_u46
ok um and the fact what makes that more likely is the fact that it's on one side and that you've got some sensitivity to light|day2_consultation10_doctor_u47
ok so what what i think we can do is um i think we can give you some um generic pain relief|day2_consultation10_doctor_u48
that would be the appropriate first step for migraine type headaches ok so i'll tell you what it is in a second|day2_consultation10_doctor_u49
and the other thing that i was gonna suggest is we maybe look explore things to try and decrease the stress from work|day2_consultation10_doctor_u50
so um the medication wise the things that we'd start off first line if someone had migraine was to would be to start ibuprofen|day2_consultation10_doctor_u51
and um uh that the doses of ibuprofen can be a bit more than the normal doses ibuprofen so that's one thing we can start you can keep on taking paracetamol as well if you like but the the ibuprofen's um actually more effective for migraine|day2_consultation10_doctor_u52
and um yeah so the the guidelines have changed recently we used we before that we used to give paracetamol as first line but now it's um ibuprofen or aspirin|day2_consultation10_doctor_u53
that's thing um the other thing i'd like you to do is maybe consider taking some time off work ok because if the headache is due to stress from work|day2_consultation10_doctor_u54
um maybe having a week off if you self certify that might help with things and i'd also like you to explore counselling options as well so there's a counselling service in your area that i can give you the link for for you to self refer|day2_consultation10_doctor_u55
i'd like you to ok i'd like you to try that um what we're gonna do is we'll have a follow up in a week's time|day2_consultation10_doctor_u56
as well as those two things other things i'd like you to do is to try and ensure that you're having a minimum of seven eight hours sleep at night every night and you're drinking a minimum of um one point five to two litres uh of water or fluids a day and that's not including coffee or tea|day2_consultation10_doctor_u57
all right because sometimes dehydration and you know uh fatigue can be causes of headaches as well um|day2_consultation10_doctor_u58
yeah so it that that that is um you know we need to rule those things out um let's let's try that|day2_consultation10_doctor_u59
ok um and let's have a follow up appointment if we're finding that things are not getting better we might need to arrange some blood tests or um look at uh other possibilities but we'll try that in the first instance|day2_consultation10_doctor_u60
um if anything changes in the meantime or you get worried or things get worse feel free have a lower threshold for ringing us back and we can book you an appointment and we can reassess the situation|day2_consultation10_doctor_u61
ok no problem so there'll be a summary of all of this in the notes um and i'll also leave a link to some of the danger signs of symptoms of headaches in the notes if you can read through that in your own time that will just help you to have a bit more control over what's going on and understanding of what what what kind of things should trigger you contacting another doctor|day2_consultation10_doctor_u62
no problem ok so we'll we'll touch base in a week's time with me or myself or one of the other doctors and we we'll take it from there ok|day2_consultation10_doctor_u63
brilliant ok then all right take care then all the best|day2_consultation10_doctor_u64
bye bye|day2_consultation10_doctor_u65
