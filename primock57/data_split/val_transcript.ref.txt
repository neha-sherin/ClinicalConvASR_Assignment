laxepro|day3_consultation10_doctor_u38
ok not heard of it may is it like salbutamol is it like a blue colour|day3_consultation10_doctor_u39
yellow ok i'll have to check that one not sure laxepro|day3_consultation10_doctor_u40
ok um that's fine any other medication that you're using|day3_consultation10_doctor_u41
over the counter anything at all|day3_consultation10_doctor_u42
ok right any allergies|day3_consultation10_doctor_u43
no allergies at all righty fine so obviously you know you just have diarrhea it's about four to five times a day um you're still drinking plenty and you look like you're not dehydrated which is a good sign ok um when we start worrying about diarrhea is if you're going more than eight times a day|day3_consultation10_doctor_u44
that means probably you are you know whatever you're eating is going straight through ok you still need to drink plenty of water because you're losing a lot of fluids|day3_consultation10_doctor_u45
ok when you go to the toilet um things that one would advise is a soft diet so avoid dairy fish meat eggs while you're having the diarrhea go sorry|day3_consultation10_doctor_u46
ok so that will be like crackers toast jam those kind of things that's easily digested like what we are good give babies yeah when they start eating you give simple food for babies you don't give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding so that's the kind of soft diet we're talking about yeah once you are able to you know keep most of it in you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash|day3_consultation10_doctor_u47
once you're ok with that for about forty eight hours then you can start having meat so just don't have meat once you feel like you're slightly better because you might go back to square one again all right|day3_consultation10_doctor_u48
forty eight hours you're not having any diarrhea you're fine then you can go and start having meat egg fish and all so that|day3_consultation10_doctor_u49
no no no preferably just don't because what why do we say this it's because it takes much more time for meat to get digested so because your gut flora you know the the the bacteria in your gut is not you know as it should be it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food|day3_consultation10_doctor_u50
while it doesn't take that much of an effort to you know digest mash and vegetables does that make sense|day3_consultation10_doctor_u51
yeah so um at the same time you could have some although you can't milk is not a good idea yoghurts are a good idea because they are probiotics it help to build up the normal um gut gut bacteria back|day3_consultation10_doctor_u52
ok|day3_consultation10_doctor_u53
so those kinda now things to look out for if your diarrhoea doesn't go away in a week's time or if you're passing blood we need a stool sample because that means you you may have um some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics|day3_consultation10_doctor_u54
ok if you're again as i've mentioned previously if you're going about six to eight times a day that means there's a high chance that uh you are having dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time if that happens you get in touch with us again all right|day3_consultation10_doctor_u55
any questions you look a bit confused|day3_consultation10_doctor_u56
yeah ok and also you could get something called dioralyte over the counter so it helps to uh replenish your the salts that you've been that's lost through going to the toilet|day3_consultation10_doctor_u57
ok if you're a bit confused you know you can actually uh all this is all recorded in your app so you can go back i'll put that all in detail so if you know i know sometimes it's a bit difficult to process everything you can go back and read read the notes|day3_consultation10_doctor_u58
is that ok|day3_consultation10_doctor_u59
all right then you take care|day3_consultation10_doctor_u60
bye now bye bye|day3_consultation10_doctor_u61
hello hi um should we start yeah okay hello how um good morning sir how can i help you this morning|day1_consultation01_doctor_u0
sorry to hear that um and and when you say diarrhea what'd you mean by diarrhea do you mean you're going to the toilet more often or are your stools more loose|day1_consultation01_doctor_u1
okay and how many times a day are you going let's say in the last couple of days|day1_consultation01_doctor_u3
six seven times a day and you mention it's mainly watery have you noticed any other things like blood in your stools|day1_consultation01_doctor_u4
okay and you mentioned you've had some pain in your tummy as well whereabouts is the pain exactly|day1_consultation01_doctor_u5
one side and what side is that|day1_consultation01_doctor_u6
left side okay and can you describe the pain to me|day1_consultation01_doctor_u7
okay and is the pain is that is it there all the time or does it come and go|day1_consultation01_doctor_u8
come and go does the pain move anywhere else for example towards your back|day1_consultation01_doctor_u9
okay fine and you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak and shaky as well what do you mean by shaky do you mean you've been having uh have you been feeling feverish for example|day1_consultation01_doctor_u10
you measure your temperature then|day1_consultation01_doctor_u12
okay okay any other symptoms like sweating or um night sweats no and uh any vomiting at all|day1_consultation01_doctor_u13
you stopped vomiting okay and was your vomit i know it's not a nice thing to talk about but was it just normal food colour yeah and there was no blood in your vomit is that right|day1_consultation01_doctor_u14
no okay um and um any any other symptoms at all so you mentioned tummy pain you mentioned diarrhea you mentioned your vomiting uh anything else that comes to mind|day1_consultation01_doctor_u15
okay|day1_consultation01_doctor_u16
okay so you're drinking fluids um what kind of foods have you managed to eat if anything|day1_consultation01_doctor_u17
okay fine um and sir these started three days ago the symptoms are you aware of any triggers which may have caused the symptoms uh to kick on so for example think like takeaway foods or eating out or being around other people with similar symptoms|day1_consultation01_doctor_u18
okay|day1_consultation01_doctor_u19
do you remember where you ate|day1_consultation01_doctor_u20
okay anyone else unwell with similar symptoms|day1_consultation01_doctor_u21
okay okay fine um alright and uh in terms of your your overall health are you normally fit and well or uh|day1_consultation01_doctor_u22
okay and is your asthma well controlled|day1_consultation01_doctor_u23
fine and you don't have any other tummy problem bowel problems i should be aware of|day1_consultation01_doctor_u24
no okay um and apart from the inhalers do you take any other medications|day1_consultation01_doctor_u25
okay fine and in terms of just your day to day life you said it's been affecting your life um in what way has it been affecting your life|day1_consultation01_doctor_u26
okay|day1_consultation01_doctor_u27
yeah|day1_consultation01_doctor_u28
and have you are you currently working at the moment|day1_consultation01_doctor_u29
would would work|day1_consultation01_doctor_u30
okay have you been going into work the last three days or have you been at home|day1_consultation01_doctor_u31
okay that must be difficult for you then|day1_consultation01_doctor_u32
fine and you said you mentioned you live with your wife and two children is that right|day1_consultation01_doctor_u33
right alright um just a couple of other question we need to ask sir um do you smoke at all|day1_consultation01_doctor_u34
and do you drink much in the way of alcohol|day1_consultation01_doctor_u35
okay so um er normally at this stage i like to um examine you if that's okay but um um but but having listened to your story sir i think uh um just to recap for the last three days you've been having loose stool diarrhea a bit of tummy pain uh mainly on the left hand side um and vomiting and fever and you're quite weak and lethargic um you mentioned you had this chinese takeaway as little as three days ago and i wondered whether that might be the cause of your problems|day1_consultation01_doctor_u36
um it seems like you may have something uh called gastroenteritis which essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your uh of your tummy|day1_consultation01_doctor_u37
uh mainly caused by viruses but there can be a possibility of bacteria uh causing its symptoms um|day1_consultation01_doctor_u38
at this stage uh what what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management so um i don't think you need anything like antibiotics it's really just um making sure you're well hydrated so drinking fluids|day1_consultation01_doctor_u39
um there are things like dioralyte you can get from the pharmacy which uh it's um it helps helps replenish your minerals and vitamins|day1_consultation01_doctor_u40
um and if you are having vomiting diarrhea i would say recommend that in the first you know first couple of days|day1_consultation01_doctor_u41
if you are feeling feverish and weak eh taking some paracetamol uh two tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help|day1_consultation01_doctor_u42
i will certainly advise you to take some time off work actually i know you're quite keen to work but i would say the next two two to three days as the infection clears from your system to take some time off and rest|day1_consultation01_doctor_u43
um i'll admit if your symptoms haven't got better you know in in three to four days i'd like to come and see you again|day1_consultation01_doctor_u44
because if it is ongoing then we have to wonder whether something else caused your symptoms|day1_consultation01_doctor_u45
uh and we may need to do further tests like um taking a sample of your stool so we can test that|day1_consultation01_doctor_u46
um etcetera etcetera|day1_consultation01_doctor_u47
how's that sound|day1_consultation01_doctor_u48
do you have any questions for me|day1_consultation01_doctor_u49
okay and is uh is the treatment plan clear|day1_consultation01_doctor_u50

ok that's when your middle earthere is something um some inflammation going on there and there is some imbalances in the crystals there in your middle ear|day3_consultation05_doctor_u35
ok so what the most important treatment is actually giving you some kind of middle ear stability so that you won't feel as if you're going around in a boat kind of feeling|day3_consultation05_doctor_u36
ok so that's what we need to because to actually make you function a bit more we'll start you on certain medications|day3_consultation05_doctor_u37

ok and how is that is that quite stressful long hours|day1_consultation06_doctor_u57
mm|day1_consultation06_doctor_u58
yeah that's certainly a consideration isn't it so let's let's try and get you better soon so it doesn't have any um impact on your on your job|day1_consultation06_doctor_u59
uh and do you find yourself doing a lot of anti social hours do you do you do a lot of night driving weekend driving|day1_consultation06_doctor_u60
ok|day1_consultation06_doctor_u62
ok alright and what about smoking and alcohol so 'cause that can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems do you do you smoke at all|day1_consultation06_doctor_u63
so you used to smoke|day1_consultation06_doctor_u64
and how many did you smoke a day on average|day1_consultation06_doctor_u65
um and how many how many years was that for|day1_consultation06_doctor_u66
ok and what about the stopping that must have been difficult for you stopping um and what what about alcohol|day1_consultation06_doctor_u67
ok do you do much in the way of exercise sir|day1_consultation06_doctor_u68
ok|day1_consultation06_doctor_u69
ok|day1_consultation06_doctor_u70
right ok and certainly now your symptoms you you're you said you're feeling more breathless even walking to the uh to the shop she said|day1_consultation06_doctor_u71
um right ohh um based on your based on you history and having listened to your story i i wonder whether you've had a flare up of your heart failure sir um|day1_consultation06_doctor_u72
which can sometimes happen um um and uh|day1_consultation06_doctor_u73
it's so it seems like your heart's not pumping as well as it should be um and obviously having diagnosed with heart failure there's obviously|day1_consultation06_doctor_u74
um that's the first thing that comes to my mind um now there's a couple of options move forward um|day1_consultation06_doctor_u75
given that you're otherwise well at the moment and having examined you your chest and your saturations and blood pressure are all ok|day1_consultation06_doctor_u76
i'm quite happy to increase your dose of furosemide maybe rather than one tablet a day we can do two tablets a day for the first few days|day1_consultation06_doctor_u77
um and see and see how you're getting on|day1_consultation06_doctor_u78
uh|day1_consultation06_doctor_u79
i think i think it's it's it's definitely worth treating your symptoms but what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests like a blood test and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart to see how well your heart's pumping|day1_consultation06_doctor_u80
is that something you've had before yeah so um an it's a it's a general scan of your heart you might have had this done before when you were diagnosed and it's just to get a good|day1_consultation06_doctor_u81
sorry|day1_consultation06_doctor_u82
you remember that ok fine that's something i can organize for you today and and that might take a week or two weeks for that to be organized but i think certainly in the meantime let's um|day1_consultation06_doctor_u83
let's let's get a blood test done we can check your um you know your full blood count look for signs of anemia we can have a check of your kidney function|day1_consultation06_doctor_u84
um and we can definitely increase your um your furosemide uh to you know one tablet twice a day|day1_consultation06_doctor_u85
but i really like would like you to come back and see me in about a week's time see how you're getting on that sound reasonable|day1_consultation06_doctor_u86
and of course in the meantime if you are getting more unwell feel like you're getting more breathless or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain or palpitations or dizziness then uh you know i want you to give me a call sooner than that and we can have a chat on the phone as well|day1_consultation06_doctor_u87

ohh you had it this morning ok ohh right all right|day2_consultation04_doctor_u31
ok um um couple of things i'd like to do in order to try and um get an idea of how unwell you are|day2_consultation04_doctor_u32
ok um the first thing i'd like to do is to try and measure your pulse|day2_consultation04_doctor_u33
so what the way we're gonna do this is that if you're if i can get you to try and locate the pulse in your wrist|day2_consultation04_doctor_u34
not everyone can do this so don't worry if you can't|day2_consultation04_doctor_u35
but if you if you can tell me whether you can feel the regular pulse it's just under the thumb if you put two fingers up and down like that you might be able to feel the pulse|day2_consultation04_doctor_u36
you got it ok are you sure|day2_consultation04_doctor_u37
all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to tell you when to start counting and when to stop counting ok so i'll just get my stopwatch up|day2_consultation04_doctor_u38
ok so if you can um you've still got the pulse|day2_consultation04_doctor_u39
ok so if you can start counting now please|day2_consultation04_doctor_u40
if you can stop now that i think that was about eleven or twelve um so that would make your heart rate about sixty six to seventy four that's that's ok good|day2_consultation04_doctor_u41
fantastic and the next thing i'd like you to try and do ok um it depends on the lighting so it may not be possible|day2_consultation04_doctor_u42
but the next thing i'd like you to try and do is just to get you to squeeze the tip of your finger|day2_consultation04_doctor_u43
and then let me see how quickly the redness come back ok so if you can see what i'm doing now my finger's come right behind the screen i'm squeezing it ok just watch me first it's all right just watch me first yeah i'm i'm squeezing it|day2_consultation04_doctor_u44
and then you can see that it goes pale and then it goes back to the normal red colour ok|day2_consultation04_doctor_u45
so if i can get you just to put your finger up to the your camera and then with the other hand just try and squeeze it and see|day2_consultation04_doctor_u46
ok perfect that's great thank you so much|day2_consultation04_doctor_u47
the last thing i'd like to do is i'd like to try and have a look down your throat|day2_consultation04_doctor_u48
ok are are you doing this consultation via um a phone or a laptop|day2_consultation04_doctor_u49
a phone|day2_consultation04_doctor_u50
sorry say that again|day2_consultation04_doctor_u51
ok ok so if you if you um position your device up above your head put your head back mouth open wide and let me see if i can have a that's fantastic and say ah|day2_consultation04_doctor_u53
perfect thank you for that excellent|day2_consultation04_doctor_u55
ok last thing is if i can get you to feel inside your neck just on the sides here ok um by your adam's apple tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not|day2_consultation04_doctor_u56
ok|day2_consultation04_doctor_u57
all right um|day2_consultation04_doctor_u58
now um uh sorry i've forgotten your name|day2_consultation04_doctor_u59
doris ok doris um so so doris um what what i think we need to do is um this sounds like you might have a chest infection|day2_consultation04_doctor_u61
ok if you're coughing up blood and you're feeling your heart racing um|day2_consultation04_doctor_u62
uh i think you need to be examined today someone needs to listen to your chest|day2_consultation04_doctor_u63
and um maybe check your blood pressure as well check that you're stable i have to say examining you now from what limited examination i could do online|day2_consultation04_doctor_u64
you're everything does seem to be ok in terms of you you don't seem acutely unstable|day2_consultation04_doctor_u65
however if you've got this kind of pain um when taking a deep breath in and you're coughing up blood we do do we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have a pneumonia or chest infection|day2_consultation04_doctor_u66
and um that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope and you may need um an antibiotic uh there's one thing i need to ask you have you been on any long haul flight recently|day2_consultation04_doctor_u67
no ok have you ever had any clots in your legs or clots in your lung blood clots|day2_consultation04_doctor_u68
no ok anyone in the family have that|day2_consultation04_doctor_u69
no ok all right um what i think we'll do is um we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today|day2_consultation04_doctor_u70
ok um i would like someone to listen to your chest and check your blood pressure|day2_consultation04_doctor_u71
and to to recheck your pulse as well just make sure and check your temperature make sure all those parameters are ok|day2_consultation04_doctor_u72
you may well need an antibiotic ok um do you have any allergies to any antibiotics|day2_consultation04_doctor_u73
no ok um i i'm not i'm gonna not i'm not going to prescribe anything for you now because i think you need to have that basic assessment first|day2_consultation04_doctor_u74
um before we proceed to the next step but the that's what i would predict the next step might be um i'm going to leave the number in the notes for this appointment for you to ring our support team|day2_consultation04_doctor_u75
and then they will book you in for a face to face appointment with one of our gps today|day2_consultation04_doctor_u76
and then they'll do that assessment and then we'll take it from there ok|day2_consultation04_doctor_u77
um uh given the the way in which you uh have presented now just one day with a fever and this slight pain concurrent with the the blood in the the the flem|day2_consultation04_doctor_u78
that's not usually how lung cancer is presented it's more insidious over a longer period of time with other symptoms|day2_consultation04_doctor_u79
um however we might need to get some investigations to exclude that it depends on the examination finding when we see you|day2_consultation04_doctor_u80
all right are you worried about lung cancer|day2_consultation04_doctor_u81
sure of course yeah so just remind me how old you are again i'm sorry|day2_consultation04_doctor_u82
forty five ok it's something we do need to be cognisant of ok um and we may end up having to do a follow up chest x ray if things don't settle down but at the moment it it seems more like a chest infection rather than a lung cancer|day2_consultation04_doctor_u83
yeah that that is good to know yeah so that's 'cause that's easier to treat but we still need to make sure that things are ok because chest infections can become nasty as well|day2_consultation04_doctor_u84
it can lead to infection inside the body we want to avoid that as well so let's get you checked out today and hopefully we can put your mind to rest and get you on the right course of treatment|day2_consultation04_doctor_u85
all right you're welcome all right take care then all the best|day2_consultation04_doctor_u86

um uh if you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathlessness um or breathlessness that you are concerned about then i would advise you to see no go and see a gp um and actually see somebody physically|day4_consultation07_doctor_u54
