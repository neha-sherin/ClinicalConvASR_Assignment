yep a week ago ok all right|day1_consultation10_doctor_u29
what i'm trying get at is whether um uh there's any chance you could be pregnant at all uh i know you're on the pill but um we're we nonetheless we do have to ask um when was your last when was your last period|day1_consultation10_doctor_u30
two weeks ago ok all right just something for us to bear in mind if your symptoms don't get any better ok um|day1_consultation10_doctor_u31
fine in terms of your general health otherwise at the moment are you uh eating and drinking ok|day1_consultation10_doctor_u32
sure well thanks for sharing with me um so i i don't think it's is related to your symptoms i think it probably just pure pure coincidence um|day1_consultation10_doctor_u34
but uh you know i do strongly advise you to you know um make it a regular habit if you can um just for your just for your general health moving forwards ok|day1_consultation10_doctor_u35
um fine moving on in terms of your health otherwise do you have any other medical conditions apart from the ibs is there anything else i should be aware of|day1_consultation10_doctor_u36
no ok great and what about any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the um combined pill|day1_consultation10_doctor_u37
was it yeah ok|day1_consultation10_doctor_u38
ok and is that for the cramps the crampy pain|day1_consultation10_doctor_u39
yeah ok and do you have any allergy to any medications|day1_consultation10_doctor_u40
ok ok ok|day1_consultation10_doctor_u41
ritib ok sure i'll make a note of that um in terms of family history any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys|day1_consultation10_doctor_u42
no or generally anything else good and socially tell me a bit more about your home situation who's at home with you|day1_consultation10_doctor_u43
very good|day1_consultation10_doctor_u45
great and what are you studying at university|day1_consultation10_doctor_u46
english ok good and how are you enjoying your course|day1_consultation10_doctor_u47
good|day1_consultation10_doctor_u48
very good very good good um in terms of smoking and alcohol do you do you participate in either|day1_consultation10_doctor_u49
o k|day1_consultation10_doctor_u50
ok what what's made you have your first joint last week was|day1_consultation10_doctor_u51
ok|day1_consultation10_doctor_u52
sure uh and obviously as your doctor i'm here to look after you so yeah i i would strongly recommend you you know to avoid if you can great um fine so at this stage i wouldn't normally examine you but i think based on your story i think um you know uh i'm reassured|day1_consultation10_doctor_u54
but the fact that i i i think it's um probably just a simple what we'd say a uti or a cystitis bladder infection|day1_consultation10_doctor_u55
uh you know you haven't got any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about so things like fevers and back pain|day1_consultation10_doctor_u56
um would be more worrying for me to hear um so it's something we can treat quite readily with antibiotics um so we've got a choice of two antibiotics something called trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin which is a three day course|day1_consultation10_doctor_u57
and normally they're usually quite effective um for your symptoms it's probably worth giving us a urine sample today as well if you can so we can send it off to the lab|day1_consultation10_doctor_u58
and see exactly what's going on there um start the antibiotics make sure you're well hydrated drink plenty of fluids|day1_consultation10_doctor_u59
um if you are having some pain simple paracetamol um would probably be advisable|day1_consultation10_doctor_u60
um we'll see what the urine sample shows um and if it is indeed positive we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones|day1_consultation10_doctor_u61
um but if things still are still not getting any better next week come back and see me and we can have another look again|day1_consultation10_doctor_u62
so if i'll give yeah no it's a well uh so yeah good question so i will give you i will organise uh for you to come in and drop off a sample at one of our practices um which we can test there and then at the urine and send it off to the lab uh we can back in touch with you with the results|day1_consultation10_doctor_u63
ok do bear in mind those symptoms i mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting if you have any of those give me a call ok|day1_consultation10_doctor_u64

fantastic ok now do you have any other illnesses at all|day2_consultation05_doctor_u42
no are you on any medication|day2_consultation05_doctor_u43
ok so so why is that why do you take that|day2_consultation05_doctor_u44
ok do have you ever told a doctor before your gp that you're on aspirin|day2_consultation05_doctor_u45
ok uh and has any gp ever spoken to you about the risks of aspirin and whether you should be on it or have you not told the the gp in the past|day2_consultation05_doctor_u46
you haven't ok um all right um now um in terms of your uh your kind of social situation um are you working at the moment|day2_consultation05_doctor_u47
what do you work as|day2_consultation05_doctor_u48
you're a a a medical doctor|day2_consultation05_doctor_u49
ok uh which specialty are you in|day2_consultation05_doctor_u50
plastic surgery ok great and um do you have any um allergies to any medication at all|day2_consultation05_doctor_u51
ok and um are you um living alone|day2_consultation05_doctor_u52
right ok um fantastic uh do you smoke at all|day2_consultation05_doctor_u53
right ok um that's fine now obviously you're a you're a medic yourself did you have any thoughts as to what might be going on|day2_consultation05_doctor_u54
right ok um well the the way you're describing these episodes they make me concerned about mini strokes or tias transient ischemic attacks um|day2_consultation05_doctor_u55
and so that's something quite urgent and given that you've got a family history of um stroke|day2_consultation05_doctor_u56
um even though you're quite young i think um it's something that we need to exclude so what i'm probably going to do uh in fact what i am going to do is i'm going to refer you to a stroke a tia clinic|day2_consultation05_doctor_u57
um now just to double check do you have the symptoms right now|day2_consultation05_doctor_u58
ok so so what i'm gonna do is i'm uh i'm gonna refer you to a a mini stroke clinic or a tia clinic|day2_consultation05_doctor_u59
um i send that referral off now and then you can attend them they they'll usually call you in within the next one to two days ok|day2_consultation05_doctor_u60
because it's something relatively urgent now today it's wednesday so we've got a few days before the weekend so um uh basically the deadline should be thursday friday|day2_consultation05_doctor_u61
we're expecting you to be seen by the time that's the kind of turnaround we're we're looking at|day2_consultation05_doctor_u62
and in that clinic they'll be doing a number of things um they'll be checking they'll be doing a ultrasound of the carotid arteries like your your father had um and they'll be doing a maybe a they might do a scan of your brain as well to check if there's any signs of a bleed there|day2_consultation05_doctor_u63
but um they'll be doing a range of tests in a short time frame in order to exclude whether you have um any illness ok whether you have got any kind of stroke or mini stroke|day2_consultation05_doctor_u64
now if your symptoms return and they persist they're prolonged then um you may need to attend a and e|day2_consultation05_doctor_u65
ok because um our presumptive working diagnosis is mini stroke or tia ok|day2_consultation05_doctor_u66
and if a mini stroke is prolonged then uh then we end up thinking that this might be a stroke and in that case that becomes even more of an emergency so we're not talking about waiting one or two days we want you to go to hospital in that instance as soon as possible ok|day2_consultation05_doctor_u67
now if things happen again feel free to contact us we can assess you over the phone we can give you direction and guidance over the phone that's that's that's not a problem you know you you've got easy access to us|day2_consultation05_doctor_u68
ok so um this is the plan going forward um i'm going to um do that referral|day2_consultation05_doctor_u69
you should hear back from the hospital relatively soon|day2_consultation05_doctor_u70
the hospital you can actually ring them on um uh the pals number and then there's also the tia clinic number|day2_consultation05_doctor_u71
i'm going to leave that number in the notes for this consultation ok so you'll have all the information you need to chase this appointment|day2_consultation05_doctor_u72
and um if you want you can ring them either today or tomorrow morning|day2_consultation05_doctor_u73
today in the afternoon wait uh one or two hours or tomorrow morning just to find out when they got time to slot you in and just to make sure they've got you in the system that they've got in the books and they're going to be calling you in ok|day2_consultation05_doctor_u74
this isn't a an immediate emergency that you need to rush down to a and e but it's something quite urgent we need to deal with in a short space of time ok|day2_consultation05_doctor_u75
so if there's if there's any delay that transpires for example you can't make the appointment or you know they you don't get called you you get get in contact back back with us ok|day2_consultation05_doctor_u76
all right did you have any questions at all|day2_consultation05_doctor_u77
ok great so just bear with me a few minutes and then i'll send that uh all through and then you should um you should be able to help you should have the information at your hands to in order to take things further ok|day2_consultation05_doctor_u78

and um have you tried anything yourself for this problem|day5_consultation06_doctor_u51
what could you just repeat that|day5_consultation06_doctor_u52
ok and how often have you been taking that|day5_consultation06_doctor_u53
ok um and do you feel like your symptoms are easing off or getting worse or|day5_consultation06_doctor_u54
yeah|day5_consultation06_doctor_u55
ok|day5_consultation06_doctor_u56
um|day5_consultation06_doctor_u57
i mean it sounds like because your brother's had a similar thing it sounds like it might be some an infectious gastroenteritis that you've got which is usually caused by a virus but it can be from something you've eaten as well um|day5_consultation06_doctor_u58
if the symptoms they do normally start to settle by themselves with the oral rehydration salts um if the symptoms are continuing to get worse the key thing is that we want to make sure that you're hydrated enough|day5_consultation06_doctor_u59
um sometimes you do require certain medication to help this if it's sometimes if it's caused by a bacteria um what i would say probably worth as it's been going on for a few days and you feel like it's not starting to ease off|day5_consultation06_doctor_u60
i think it's probably important to get a sample of the stool so we can make sure that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection which needs specific treatment|day5_consultation06_doctor_u61
um and we should also check that you're not getting dehydrated because if you're if you're not keeping fluid down then you can get dehydrated|day5_consultation06_doctor_u62
um so|day5_consultation06_doctor_u63
yeah so you need to carry on with your rehydration salts and just have very small amounts it's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago so you're obviously still um hydrated enough to pass urine|day5_consultation06_doctor_u64
but we um we should see you so that we can check your hydration and um get that sample sent off as soon as possible|day5_consultation06_doctor_u65
'cause if if if you come into the clinic you can send that sample off straightaway otherwise we would have to post it out to you which would take time|day5_consultation06_doctor_u66
um so we can we can make you an urgent appointment um and then you can you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration um but if in the meantime you're feeling more unwell then we would get you seen urgently in a and e|day5_consultation06_doctor_u67
so you can call us back in the meantime|day5_consultation06_doctor_u68
yeah if you keep drinking keep going with the rehydration salts just tiny sips constantly to so that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and and you vomit so just tiny tiny sips but just keep going with it|day5_consultation06_doctor_u69
um and just have very simple food if you're gonna have anything like toast or biscuit or something really light like that avoid um fruit vegetables uh milk anything like that which might just make it worse|day5_consultation06_doctor_u70
ok so you'll have to book an appointment through the support line|day5_consultation06_doctor_u71
right ok we'll do that for you|day5_consultation06_doctor_u72
ok take care|day5_consultation06_doctor_u73
thanks bye|day5_consultation06_doctor_u74
